Some people feel relieved that they have finally come to terms with their difficulties, while other people feel grief because they missed out on opportunities in their lives because of symptoms that were not treated for so long.\n\nA health professional or mental health professional can diagnose ADHD by examining the person's mood and past mental and physical health conditions, and their childhood behavior and school experiences. The evaluation includes ADHD symptoms scales and checklists.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPeople suffering from ADHD struggle to accomplish tasks that require a lot of mental effort or paying attention to details. In many cases, these problems result from other underlying issues such as depression or substance abuse disorders. The first step in tackling symptoms that cause havoc on a personal and professional scale is to get a proper ADHD diagnosis.\n\nThe signs of ADHD typically begin in childhood and continue into adulthood. To be considered to have ADHD, symptoms must result in significant impairment in at minimum two areas of a person's life (home, school, and work). To meet this criteria, they must have lasted at least six month and cannot be explained by other mental disorders such as mood disorders, anxiety disorder dissociative disorder or personality disorders.\n\nThe health care provider will also review the patient's medical and mental history. The doctor will speak to the patient and, if they are able, their family members, in order to gain an understanding of childhood behavior. The health care provider will also meet with the patient's teacher and review their current work and home environments.\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association provides clinical guidelines to diagnose ADHD in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition. To be diagnosed with read review of ADHD, a person must show six or fewer symptoms of inattention that are serious enough to affect their daily functioning. To be diagnosed with the hyperactive/impulsive type of ADHD, an individual must have six of the following symptoms:\n\nA thorough psychiatric assessment is usually enough for a health professional to identify someone with ADHD. This involves an extensive interview with the person and their parents, and any other caregivers or teachers, as well as completing scales or questionnaires. The health care provider may also examine the person's medical, psychiatric and family history and refer the person to a physical exam in order to determine if there are any other causes of symptoms. The doctor will also take a look at the person's sleep habits, diet and work and home environment to determine any stressors that may be contributing to their symptoms.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nIf you think you may have ADHD, you should consult a specialist doctor in the field. Your doctor will inquire about your symptoms and their impact on your life. They will want to know if you have difficulty completing tasks, if you frequently lose things, or are unable to remember where you left your keys. They might also inquire about whether or not these problems result in stress at work, home, or in relationships. Your doctor will also review the medical history and physical exam. This information can aid your doctor in determining other conditions which may mimic the symptoms of ADHD, such a sleep disorders, depression anxiety, thyroid disorders or anxiety.\n\nIt's likely that your healthcare professional will ask family members as well as other caregivers about your behavior. They will also discuss your behavior in different situations, such as at school, at work or with religious or scout leaders. Your doctor might also request that you fill out self-tests or a rating scale to determine the severity of your symptoms. You can find these online, but they shouldn't be used in lieu for a face-toface consultation with your doctor.\n\nFor adults, a diagnosis of ADHD requires you to meet the threshold of symptoms lower than kids -- five out of nine signs over the course of six months. You'll also have to make an impact on your school, work and personal life.\n\nIf your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend neuropsychological or psychological testing to determine if you have the inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD. These tests usually look at the ways your brain functions and can help determine if you suffer from coexisting mental disorders such as depression or anxiety.\n\nBeing diagnosed with ADHD as an adult can trigger complicated emotions. Matlen's emotions ranged from sadness over missed opportunities to relief that she finally had a solid reason for her problems. Ask your doctor or local support group to refer you to a health specialist who conducts ADHD assessments for adults. You can also call your insurance provider to determine which providers are listed.\n\nTreatment\n\nMedication is often the first option for a lot of people with ADHD. Stimulants like methylphenidate or amphetamine work by increasing or balancing neurotransmitters, brain chemicals that regulate behavior and attention. They can help those with ADHD focus better and stay focused, control their impulses and make more rational decisions improve communication and relationships and reduce impulsive behaviors.\n\nThere are also nonstimulant medicines such as atomoxetine, and antidepressants that are slower than stimulants, but may still be effective for some patients with ADHD. The type of medication that works best for a person may vary over time, which is why it is important to discuss all possible options with your healthcare professional who conducts the test.\n\nA medical expert with expertise in ADHD will conduct a thorough assessment. This may include an interview, the submission of scales, questionnaires, and a review of family history, mood disorders and medical conditions like sleep disorders, as well as other physical illnesses. A referral to a medical exam may also be included to rule out medical reasons for the ADHD symptoms.\n\nThe test will likely take some time, especially in the case of an adult who has been struggling to manage symptoms for a long period of time. The evaluation should be as thorough as possible, which means that the patient should bring copies of the performance evaluations from their workplace or school and other documents such as old report cards. The healthcare professional might ask permission to talk with close friends or relatives to get a full picture of the person's past experiences and behaviours.\n\nFor adults, getting diagnosed with ADHD can be a life-changing experience. It is normal for people to experience a mixture of emotions, from relief at finally getting a reason for their problems to sadness over lost opportunities and relationships that were damaged by untreated ADHD. However, Matlen says that once she had a diagnosis she was able to make changes in her life and move forward with her career and relationships.\n\nCounseling\n\nFinding help from a counselor is a vital step for a lot of people suffering from ADHD. Finding the right therapist isn't always easy. Fortunately, there are many ways to locate a specialist in your area. Begin by asking your physician for the referral. He or she might have a list with specialists who are skilled in treating ADHD. You can also look online. There are numerous websites that offer directories of doctors that include details about their areas of focus and areas of expertise. Asking friends or family for suggestions is another option. You can also reach out to your local mental health clinic, or an ADHD support group to receive recommendations.\n\nIt is crucial to be honest when visiting a therapist with experience in treating ADHD. This involves discussing how ADHD symptoms impact your life, as well as the impact they have on other people. It is also essential to discuss your medical history, including your past background. This will help the therapist determine if you have any conditions like depression or anxiety that can have similar symptoms.\n\nIn addition to monitoring an individual's behavior, the psychotherapist is likely to conduct interviews and employ standardized rating scales to gauge the severity of symptoms. The therapist could also ask other caregivers to provide their feedback for example, religious leaders, teachers, or scout and scout leaders in order to get an accurate picture of behavior of an individual in different situations.\n\nAdults with ADHD often feel frustrated and embarrassed by their issues and may be unwilling to talk about their issues. This can affect the accuracy and validity of the diagnosis. A therapist who has experience in working with adults with ADHD is generally able to assist them in overcoming these obstacles.\n\nIt is important to know that a diagnosis of ADHD doesn't mean that the therapist will prescribe medications. While some people suffering from ADHD might require medication but behavioral therapy is a different option that is extremely effective. These treatments can be utilized in conjunction with medication or as separate treatments.\n\n[read review](https://www.iampsychiatry.com/private-adhd-assessment)\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

You're constantly bombarded with questions. How's the team performing? Are we hitting deadlines? Are we shipping quality code? And most importantly, are we learning and growing as a team?\n\nThese are tough questions, and the answers often feel elusive. You're drowning in meetings, code reviews, and performance reviews. You need data. You need insights. You need a clear view of what's really happening within your team.\n\nThat's where [software engineering management](https://devactivity.com/pages/software-engineering-management/) tools like devActivity come in. They provide a much-needed data-driven approach to managing your team.\n\n### The Pain Points of Software Engineering Management\n\nYou're not alone. Managing software engineering teams can be a real rollercoaster. The highs of successful launches and team wins are quickly overshadowed by the lows of missed deadlines, budget overruns, and the dreaded \"we need to talk\" meeting.\n\nHere are some common pain points that software engineering managers face:\n\n- **Lack of Visibility:** It's hard to know what your team is actually working on. You can't always trust the \"everything's going great\" response when asked about project progress.\n- **Subjective Performance Reviews:** Relying on gut feeling and anecdotal evidence can lead to unfair assessments. You need a system that's more objective and data-driven.\n- **Inefficient Communication:** Code reviews can get bogged down. Communication breakdowns are a common source of frustration and delays.\n- **Burnout:** High pressure and unrealistic expectations can lead to developer burnout, which can have serious consequences.\n\n### The Power of Data-Driven Software Engineering Management\n\nHere's the good news: The days of \"flying blind\" in software engineering management are over. There are amazing tools out there designed to empower managers with the data they need to make smart decisions and improve team performance.\n\nDevActivity is one such tool. Think of it as a data-driven coach for your team. It uses GitHub data to provide a holistic view of your team's activity, performance, and overall health.\n\n### Key Benefits of Using devActivity\n\n- **Improved Visibility:** Get real-time insights into your team's activity with metrics like:\n\n  - Pull requests created and merged\n  - Code reviews conducted\n  - Issues created and resolved\n  - Cycle time for tasks\n- **Objective Performance Reviews:** DevActivity provides a wealth of data points to help you assess team performance:\n\n  - Experience Points (XP) earned for contributions\n  - Work quality metrics\n  - Coding efficiency\n  - Engagement levels\n- **Increased Communication \u0026 Collaboration:** DevActivity encourages healthy communication and collaboration by:\n\n  - Providing tools for peer recognition\n  - Improving code review efficiency\n  - Facilitating open discussion through retrospective reports\n- **Reduced Burnout:** By helping to:\n\n  - Identify workload imbalances\n  - Optimize team processes\n  - Improve communication, devActivity helps mitigate burnout.\n\n### DevActivity Helps You Manage Your Team More Effectively\n\nLet's dive deeper into how devActivity specifically empowers software engineering managers:\n\n- **Track Individual and Team Performance:** Visualize contribution trends, identify top performers, and uncover areas for improvement.\n- **Gain Actionable Insights:** Use AI-powered insights to understand bottlenecks, identify potential burnout, and optimize team processes.\n- **Implement Gamification:** Motivate your team and boost engagement with XP, levels, and achievements.\n- **Automate Processes:** Leverage automation features to streamline routine tasks like assigning reviewers and resolving alerts.\n- **Increase Transparency and Communication:** Enable open communication through peer recognition, retrospective reports, and personalized dashboards.\n\n### The Benefits of Gamification in Software Engineering Management\n\nGamification can sound a bit silly at first. But think about it this way: We all love to see progress and recognition for our work. That's exactly what devActivity does.\n\nBy introducing elements like:\n\n- **XP (experience points)** \\- Earned for each contribution\n- **Levels** \\- Determined by accumulated XP\n- **Challenges** \\- Goals that can be achieved for bonus XP\n- **Achievements** \\- Badges and recognition for milestones\n\nDevActivity taps into the human desire to achieve and progress, creating a more engaging and rewarding environment for your team. This can lead to:\n\n- **Higher Engagement:** People are more likely to contribute when they see their efforts recognized.\n- **Increased Motivation:** Seeing progress towards specific goals can lead to greater motivation.\n- **Healthy Competition:** Leaderboards can spark friendly competition and encourage greater effort.\n\n### Data-Driven Insights for a More Productive Team\n\nThink of devActivity as a data-driven assistant for managing your software engineering team. It helps you make more informed decisions based on real-time data, not just intuition or anecdotal evidence.\n\nWith devActivity, you can answer critical questions like:\n\n- **What are the biggest bottlenecks in our development process?**\n- **Who are our top performers?**\n- **Which team members are at risk of burnout?**\n- **How do our individual contributors compare to the team average?**\n- **Are we meeting our goals?**\n- **What changes can we make to improve overall team performance?**\n\n### Getting Started With devActivity:\n\nDon't just take our word for it! Here's how to get started:\n\n- **Visit the devActivity GitHub page:** [https://github.com/apps/devactivity-app](https://github.com/apps/devactivity-app)\n- **Install the app:** Grant it access to the repositories you want to track.\n- **Explore the dashboard:** Get a visual representation of your team's activity and insights.\n- **Use the free plan:** You can start for free with up to 7 contributors!\n\nDevActivity is not just a tool, it's a philosophy. It's about embracing data-driven insights and gamification to create a more efficient, collaborative, and engaged software engineering team.\n\n### FAQ:\n\n- **What types of repositories can I track with devActivity?**  - You can track both public and private repositories on GitHub.\n- **What is the difference between devActivity's Free Plan and its other plans?**  - The Free plan is ideal for smaller teams with up to 7 contributors. It includes most features, but excludes AI-powered insights. Other plans (Open Source and Premium) have no limitations on contributors and include AI-powered insights.\n- **What if I have a large team and a lot of repositories?**  - DevActivity can handle large teams and numerous repositories. It uses GitHub’s event webhooks to automatically collect and process data. However, if you have a massive repository, the initial data sync may take some time.\n- **How secure is devActivity?**  - DevActivity uses GitHub authentication and enforces security measures to protect your data. It only has read access to your repositories and does not access your code.\n- **Is devActivity compatible with other tools I'm using?**  - You can use devActivity with other software engineering management tools, like project management platforms, CI/CD tools, etc. DevActivity provides integrations with popular platforms.\n\n### **Stats:**\n\n- **46% of developers experience burnout.** (Source: Stack Overflow)\n- **50% of software engineering managers are unsure of their team’s progress.** (Source: LinearB)\n- **Teams with a clear roadmap experience 16% higher productivity.** (Source: Atlassian)\n- **86% of companies see benefits from incorporating gamification into their products or services.** (Source: Gartner)\n- **Companies with a data-driven culture have 4% to 6% higher revenue growth.** (Source: Harvard Business Review)\n\nImagine you’re trying to manage a team of marathon runners. Without a coach or a system for tracking progress, it's challenging to know if they're actually training hard enough. DevActivity is like a data-driven coach, offering real-time insights into each runner's performance, their pace, and any obstacles they’re facing.\n\n**So, what are you waiting for? Give devActivity a try and take the first step towards level-up your software engineering management game.**\n\n**_Remember: You can get started for free with up to 7 contributors._**\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Known for its lossless or minimal compression, TIFF preserves the image’s full detail, making it ideal for high-resolution storage and print projects.\n\n### Key Benefits of TIFF\n\n**\\- Lossless Quality:** TIFF files maintain every detail and nuance, making them an excellent choice for high-quality, print-ready images and professional editing.\n\n**\\- High Color Depth:** TIFF supports a large color range and depth, allowing for smooth gradients and true-to-life color, essential for projects requiring precise detail.\n\n**\\- Support for Layers:** TIFF files can store multiple layers within one image file, making them flexible for multi-layered design projects and adjustments.\n\n**\\- Ideal for Print:** Due to its high resolution and color fidelity, TIFF is a top choice for print projects where clarity and detail are paramount.\n\nHowever, TIFF files can be large and are not widely supported across digital and web applications, which limits their practicality for online use. This is where PNG can provide an effective alternative.\n\n## Understanding PNG: Portable Network Graphics\n\nPNG, or Portable Network Graphics, is a lossless raster format optimized for digital and web-based images. PNG files offer high quality with manageable file sizes, making them suitable for web graphics, digital design, and images with transparency.\n\n### Key Benefits of PNG\n\n**\\- Lossless Compression:** PNG maintains all details without sacrificing quality, making it an excellent choice for images that require sharpness and clarity without the large file size of TIFF.\n\n**\\- Transparency Support:** PNG files support alpha transparency, making them ideal for icons, logos, and design elements that need to blend seamlessly with different backgrounds.\n\n**\\- Efficient File Sizes:** Compared to TIFF, PNG files are typically smaller while still retaining quality, making them more practical for digital storage and sharing.\n\n**\\- Web Compatibility:** PNG is supported by most web browsers, applications, and platforms, ensuring that images display consistently across digital devices.\n\nWhile PNG is highly suitable for digital applications, it may not match TIFF in terms of the depth and fidelity required for professional printing and archival purposes.\n\n## Why Convert TIFF to PNG?\n\nThere are several scenarios where converting TIFF files to PNG can be beneficial, especially for web and digital applications:\n\n**\\- Reducing File Size for Digital Use:** TIFF files are often large and can be difficult to store, share, or load quickly. Converting TIFF to PNG can help reduce file size without significant quality loss, making images easier to manage and store.\n\n**\\- Enhancing Web Compatibility:** TIFF files are not widely supported on web browsers, whereas PNG files are compatible with virtually all modern web platforms. Converting to PNG ensures that images display correctly on websites and digital devices.\n\n**\\- Enabling Transparent Backgrounds for Design:** For images that require transparent backgrounds, converting from TIFF to PNG allows for alpha transparency, enabling seamless overlays and flexible design options.\n\n**\\- Improving Load Times and Performance:** PNG’s smaller file sizes allow for faster load times on websites and digital platforms, which can improve the user experience and help with SEO on image-heavy pages.\n\n## When to Use PNG Over TIFF\n\nPNG is an excellent choice for specific scenarios where storage efficiency, compatibility, and transparency are more important than absolute fidelity. Here’s when PNG may be more beneficial:\n\n**\\- Web Design and Digital Graphics:** PNG is widely used for web graphics like icons, buttons, and banners due to its efficient file size, transparency support, and fast loading times.\n\n**\\- Presentations and Documentation:** For high-quality images in presentations, reports, or PDFs, PNG offers excellent visual quality without the large file size of TIFF.\n\n**\\- Online Photo and Image Storage:** For general image storage and digital portfolios, PNG maintains quality while taking up less space, making it suitable for photo collections and archives.\n\n**\\- Logos and Icons:** PNG’s alpha transparency allows for logos, icons, and other design elements to integrate seamlessly onto any background, making it a preferred format for brand graphics and design overlays.\n\n## Limitations of Converting TIFF to PNG\n\nWhile PNG offers several benefits, converting TIFF to PNG comes with a few trade-offs:\n\n**\\- Loss of Editing Flexibility:** TIFF files can store multiple layers, which are flattened when converting to PNG. This means that layered editing is no longer possible, which can limit flexibility for future adjustments.\n\n**\\- Reduced Print Quality:** TIFF’s color depth and fidelity make it ideal for print projects. Converting to PNG may reduce color depth slightly, which could affect image quality when printed at high resolutions.\n\n**\\- File Size for Complex Images:** While PNG files are usually smaller than TIFF, highly detailed or large-resolution images may still result in larger PNG files. Careful consideration is needed to ensure that PNG is suitable for each image’s storage requirements.\n\n## Tips for Converting TIFF to PNG\n\nIf you’re ready to convert TIFF files to PNG, here are some tips to ensure high-quality results:\n\n**\\- Set the Right Resolution for Your Use Case:** Choose an appropriate resolution for the PNG based on your intended display. For web use, 72 DPI is typical, while higher DPI (e.g., 300 DPI) is suitable for digital projects that mimic print quality.\n\n**\\- Optimize Transparency as Needed:** If your image needs a transparent background, make sure to enable this feature when converting to PNG, especially for logos and design overlays.\n\n**\\- Retain Original TIFF Files for Future Editing:** Since PNG files do not support layers, keeping the original TIFF file is advisable for future edits or adjustments that may require layered elements.\n\n**\\- Test on Different Platforms:** Before finalizing your conversion, test your PNG on the intended platform or application to ensure quality and transparency are preserved.\n\n## Common Use Cases for PNG\n\nPNG is an effective format for a variety of digital applications, especially when quality and efficiency are needed. Here are some typical uses:\n\n**\\- Web Design and User Interface Elements:** PNG is ideal for UI components like buttons, icons, and logos, where quality and transparency are essential for a polished look.\n\n**\\- Digital Presentations and Reports:** For business or educational presentations, PNG images provide clarity and high-quality visuals that don’t bloat file sizes.\n\n**\\- Digital Portfolios and Artwork Displays:** Artists, designers, and photographers can use PNG for high-quality, digital portfolios that showcase work in a clear and vibrant format without excessive file size.\n\n**\\- Transparent Logos and Brand Assets:** PNG’s support for transparency allows brands to use logos and icons across a variety of backgrounds, making it an ideal choice for versatile branding elements.\n\n## Conclusion: When to Convert TIFF to PNG\n\nConverting TIFF to PNG can be advantageous when storage efficiency, transparency, and web compatibility are more important than the high-resolution detail offered by TIFF. PNG provides a great balance of quality and file size, making it an ideal choice for digital, web-based, and presentation applications where quality and efficiency are essential.\n\nIn summary, while TIFF is invaluable for high-resolution, professional-grade images, PNG offers a versatile, efficient alternative for digital use. By understanding the strengths of each format, you can make informed decisions to optimize your images for both functionality and visual appeal across various platforms and applications.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

The symptoms of ADHD can lead to anxiety and depression.\n\nA thorough assessment will include a detailed interview with you. It may also include screening questionnaires for different conditions that might resemble ADHD or coexist with it, such as depression or anxiety. Your healthcare provider may ask to interview a family member.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nIf you suspect that you may have ADHD or other related disorders, it is crucial to have an evaluation conducted by an authorized health care professional. This could be psychologist, psychiatrist or family physician, or nurse practitioner who is knowledgeable in the field of mental disorders. The assessment will include talking about your symptoms, problems they create and the ways you have tried to deal with them. The healthcare provider will examine your medical history, including any prior mental health issues as well as any other medications you're taking.\n\nThe healthcare provider has to be able to identify at least six signs (traits) of ADHD. They must be present in at least two environments (home, school, and social situations) as well as significantly affecting your ability to function. The symptoms must have been present for at least 6 months and be constant. In addition, your healthcare provider must determine whether your symptoms are inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive or a combination of both.\n\nThe signs of inattention include a tendency to forget things, losing items, and having difficulty paying attention. The school environment can also be a problem. People with inattention ADHD might not be able to follow directions, finish assignments or complete work on time. They may have trouble sitting still, paying close attention to others or focusing on their own activities. They frequently interrupt and blurt out answers before they have finished their questions. They struggle to wait for their turn in conversations or games.\n\nHyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms include restlessness, fidgeting or excessively tapping hands and speaking without thinking. This type of ADHD can lead to issues at school, home and at work. These issues are usually related to trouble in relationships and having financial problems.\n\nThe person who is conducting the assessment might want to speak with your parents or teachers, and look at any records of your behavior issues as an infant. They may also conduct a physical examination to rule out other medical conditions that may be contributing to the symptoms you're experiencing, such as thyroid issues or seizures.\n\nThey will probably recommend additional neuropsychological, psychological or learning disabilities tests when the issues you're experiencing at school, work or in your relationships require it. These tests are not able to diagnose ADHD but they can provide valuable information about how the disorder affects you.\n\nYou can also visit our website for more details.\n\nIf you suspect that you or your child is suffering from ADHD, it's important to find a certified medical expert who can assess your symptoms. You can ask your physician for recommendations. Contact your insurance provider. You can also search the internet for professionals that specialize in ADHD assessments of adults. You can also join an adult ADHD support group for recommendations.\n\nDuring the test, the person conducting it will talk to you or your child about your childhood and current life to gain a better understanding of what's happening. They might also request to talk to your teachers or others who were around you as a kid. They might ask about your medical history and previous illnesses to determine if you have any problems that look like symptoms of ADHD like anxiety or depression.\n\nThe evaluator may also use questionnaires and ratings scales to determine how often you or your child displays certain ADHD behaviors and how severe they are. These tools will help them to compare your child's symptoms to the ones of other children and adults who have been diagnosed with the condition. This is to ensure that you or your child meets the standard criteria for diagnosis. You or your child may be subject to a neurological or physical examination. They could also check for a medical condition that may be a symptom of ADHD like seizures or thyroid problems.\n\nFor children to be diagnosed with ADHD, they need to consistently demonstrate six or more of the behavioral symptoms listed in two categories -- inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity -- over the course of six months. For adults, five established symptoms in one category are needed -- either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity. adult adhd diagnosis cannot be explained by any other mental disorder like anxiety or mood disorders. The evaluator analyzes the results of the test and interview to officially diagnose ADHD. The evaluator will draft a report that outlines his or her findings and suggests solutions. Your child or you are likely to receive a copy.\n\nTreatment\n\nHaving ADHD can create difficulties in a variety of areas of life, such as family and work. Some of the signs include forgetfulness and impulsive decisions that can lead to financial problems or problems at work or at school. Family and marriage therapy can aid those suffering from ADHD overcome the obstacles they encounter in their relationships. Individual psychotherapy (also known as talk therapy) can address the feelings of anger and inadequacy that are often associated with a diagnosis of ADHD. Finding a therapist with experience working with ADHD patients and who understands their unique challenges is important.\n\nHealth professionals employ a variety of methods to assess whether someone has ADHD and this includes watching them in various settings, asking about their symptoms and how they impact their lives, analyzing their past behavior, taking tests of neuropsychology and psychological, as well as a medical examination. They may also talk with teachers and caregivers in order to obtain a complete picture of the person's life. This includes their workplace, home, and social environment.\n\nThe symptoms should be present in at minimum two locations and affect the daily activities. They have to be present for at least six months. Symptoms must have been occurring prior to age 12 and they cannot be better explained by other mental disorders, such as anxiety or depression.\n\nOlder teens and adults must meet the criteria for both the inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive types of ADHD to be diagnosed with this disorder. They must show at minimum five of the following symptoms in a variety of settings:\n\nTherapists can help you develop skills that reduce symptoms of ADHD. This includes planning ahead, keeping track of schedules and using notebooks, planners or a diary and also developing and sticking to routines. They can also help you develop communication and problem-solving abilities that can help you manage symptoms. Treatment options also include medication, lifestyle adjustments and accommodations--tools or changes in the environment that make it easier for people with a condition to function, like step stools that allow short people to reach things that are high up.\n\nSupport\n\nFor many people, getting an adult diagnosis can be a relief and the feeling of finally knowing what's going on. It's also often a time of grief due to missed opportunities in school or relationships or work that have been ruined. Matlen said that it's particularly difficult for girls and women who's symptoms might have been missed during childhood or not fully recognized as they grew.\n\nA doctor or specialist will examine the entire life history of the individual, including the adolescent years and childhood. They will look over the person's work and school records and interview them and anyone else who knows them well. They will also ask about symptoms. They will make sure that the symptoms aren't better explained by mental health issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nThe specialist may also suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to the physical exam. The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is to assist people change their thinking and behaviors to better manage their ADHD. The therapist will help the client develop strategies to improve their time management, organizational skills, and impulse control. They will also teach the patient how to recognize and avoid triggers for their ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome doctors will refer the patient to a psychiatrist who has experience in treating adults with ADHD. They can discuss the issues the person is experiencing at home, work and in relationships. They can recommend support groups and other resources for adults with ADHD.\n\nIf a person has trouble finding a specialized doctor, they can ask their primary care provider for a referral or look up their health insurance company's online directory.

While building this one of the things that became increasingly annoying was that, every time we needed to modify the system or user prompt we would have to rebuild and re-package, deploy, and then test again. While not massively time-consuming, it's a pain and a few minutes each time adds up over a day.\n\nSo, easy solution, lets move the prompts to an external file so we can edit them without needing to rebuild. But...\n\nWhat if we could make them template driven as well, and what if we could include configuration information, what if we could load them up-front and refer to them by name, and what if it was thread safe access by default (because this app is very Task oriented)?\n\nAnd so, we built [DotPrompt](https://github.com/elastacloud/DotPrompt) and, published it on GitHub, pushed the packages out to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotPrompt/) and made it available under an MIT license.\n\nI started piecing it but wanted to see if someone else had done this already. Turns out there's a couple of efforts out there, like [Firebase Genkit Dotprompt](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/dotprompt), but it's not for the DotNet ecosystem. There were a couple of others as well but they were for Python.\n\nNobody ever thinks of the DotNet devs 😭\n\nOne of the things I didn't want to do was to come up with a new format and parser for this. JSON would have been an obvious choice, but it's not exactly user friendly to write multi-line strings in. XML? No, screw that. So what about YAML? Well, it's structured, has great support for multi-line strings, and is pretty user-friendly to read and write.\n\nSo, what does a prompt file look like? Well, it looks like this.\n\n```\nname: Example\nconfig:\n  outputFormat: text\n  temperature: 0.9\n  maxTokens: 500\n  input:\n    parameters:\n      topic: string\n      style?: string\n    default:\n      topic: social media\nprompts:\n  system: |\n    You are a helpful research assistant who will provide descriptive responses for a given topic and how it impacts society\n  user: |\n    Explain the impact of {{ topic }} on how we engage with technology as a society\n    {% if style -%}\n    Can you answer in the style of a {{ style }}\n    {% endif -%}\nfewShots:\n  - user: What is Bluetooth\n    response: Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances and building personal area networks.\n  - user: How does machine learning differ from traditional programming?\n    response: Machine learning allows algorithms to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.\n  - user: Can you provide an example of AI in everyday life?\n    response: AI is used in virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, which understand and respond to voice commands.\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nWe have our configuration, and name we can refer to it as later. We've got parameters (with optional items denoted by the question mark `?`), default values, the system prompt, the user prompt, and some few-shot prompts.\n\nYou might notice that the prompt has template instructions in there. To create this we used the [Fluid](https://github.com/sebastienros/fluid/) library which is based on the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template language from Shopify. It's got some great features in it and helps to make the prompt generation pretty powerful.\n\nThe library expects the prompt files (all with the file extension of `.prompt`) to be in a folder called `prompts` in the current working directory. This means you can run your app from different directories and use different versions of the prompt files, useful if you have different tenants to target.\n\nSo, how do you use it? Well, after installing it using NuGet you can either load a prompt file directly (see the repo), or use the prompt manager like this.\n\n```\nvar promptManager = new PromptManager();\nvar promptFile = promptManager.GetPromptFile(\"example\");\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nAnd now `promptFile` has all the information needed to generate the prompts. To generate the system prompt or user prompt you pass in a dictionary of values to fill in the template (or an empty dictionary, or null if there aren't any).\n\n```\nvar systemPrompt = promptFile.GetSystemPrompt(null);\nvar userPrompt = promptFile.GetUserPrompt(new Dictionary\u003cstring, object\u003e\n{\n    { \"topic\", \"bluetooth\" },\n    { \"style\", \"used car salesman\" }\n});\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nAnd we've now got our generated prompts 🎉\n\nWe even built out some extension methods for OpenAI as we're big users of Azure OpenAI, so you don't have to generate the prompts and use them in this way, you can swap it for a method call.\n\n```\nvar promptValues = new Dictionary\u003cstring, object\u003e\n{\n    { \"topic\", \"bluetooth\" },\n    { \"style\", \"used car salesman\" }\n};\n\nvar completion = await client.CompleteChatAsync(\n    promptFile.ToOpenAiChatMessages(promptValues),\n    promptFile.ToOpenAiChatCompletionOptions()\n);\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nSo a full example would look something like this.\n\n```\nusing System.ClientModel;\nusing Azure.AI.OpenAI;\nusing DotPrompt;\nusing DotPrompt.Extensions.OpenAi;\n\nvar openAiClient = new(new Uri(\"https://endpoint\"), new ApiKeyCredential(\"abc123\"));\nvar client = openAiClient.GetChatClient(\"model\");\n\nvar promptManager = new PromptManager();\nvar promptFile = promptManager.GetPromptFile(\"example\");\n\nvar promptValues = new Dictionary\u003cstring, object\u003e\n{\n    { \"topic\", \"bluetooth\" },\n    { \"style\", \"used car salesman\" }\n};\n\nvar completion = await client.CompleteChatAsync(\n    promptFile.ToOpenAiChatMessages(promptValues),\n    promptFile.ToOpenAiChatCompletionOptions()\n);\n\nvar response = completion.Value;\nConsole.WriteLine(response.Content[0].Text);\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThe call to `ToOpenAiChatMessages` would also include the few-shot prompts if they were in the prompt file as well.\n\nAnd that's it, call to the LLM is done, we can change the parameter values on each call, and we change the prompts without re-compiling. We integrated this into our internal app and just made the whole process of tweaking so much easier. And we'll continue to dog-food the library.\n\nWe did build in a few more things as well, because why not. So it also has.\n\n- Ability to parse a prompt file from a stream\n- parameter value validation at runtime\n- Interfaces to allow the file store and the prompt manager to be mocked out or used in dependency injection scenarios\n- Because the file store has an interface, the prompt manager takes an instance of that, so you can build your own stores in case you want to hold them in something like a database (see the repo for an example)\n\nWe should probably come up with a logo for it as well, right now it's the boring NuGet default.\n\nIs there something you'd like to see it do? If so then feel free to raise it over on GitHub.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

That is the basis of lending. If you want to get approved for a large unsecured personal loan you really should provide the assurance towards the lender that you will make the repayments promptly.\n\nThe first cause of bad credit is unnecessary delay in payments together with non payments. All such kind of issues leave your financial history stained. Now, you can improve glitches your bad credit record as well, with the help of bad debt unsecured loans. To qualify for these loans, it is advisable to present a reference letter, details of a saving account, age proof and such details.\n\nSecond, compare terms many lenders. Never look at just the payments - the actual total cost of the loan, including any hidden charges like credit insurance or other fees. Don't skip the small print on the loan agreement. Don't assume that which you are being told through a loan officer is binding. It's what's written down in the agreement that matters.\n\nYou need exactly what you're really looking intended for. How much money do your REALLY need and so just why? Can you get by with less? So how exactly does plan collect the funds to match the repayment dette? What kind of repayment terms would perform best for a? Some offer monthly, some i would love you to pay on the following payday. Once you have given a little firm answers, proceed.\n\nIn unsecured personal loans, the loan processing takes place much faster than it usually does. Is actually why because actual no property to evaluate as in secured alternatives. So the publish time is a lot lower than the secured student loans.\n\nMany loved ones are facing poverty and many individuals have take bad hits on their credit bankloan histories. The usual financial institutions won't deal with bad credit loans. [https://okbaroloan.com/](https://okbaroloan.com/) have observed this market and today there absolutely are a plethora of companies willing to lend folks with not very good credit. Despite the fact that requirements are less stringent than one banks, employment is a consideration.\n\nYou obtain unsecured usecured bank loans online or offline. Most know cheaper in interest as payday or quick cash loans. They will explain up to $1,500 discover ways to be able to use it for whatever you really need it for. check credit and the requirements from these lenders aren't very precise. As long as you are 18 and have a job, you'll probably get approved for a number of loan.

However, just like all door systems, they could have issues that affect their performance.\n\nIt is important to thoroughly clean your bifold doors in order to ensure they are operating at their best. This will also prevent the build-up of dirt that could interfere with their smooth operation.\n\nLoose Hinges\n\nBifold doors, unlike traditional closet doors are hinged at the middle and fold to maximize space. They have many benefits however they can be problematic when the hardware wears out or the doors begin to fall off the track. Fortunately, these issues can often be solved with a few basic troubleshooting tips and DIY solutions.\n\nOne of the most frequent problems that arise with bifold doors is that they start to move or scrape the floor or are pulled off their tracks by wind or kids playing inside. This is due to misalignment, and can be fixed easily with a few easy steps.\n\nThe first step is to loosen the set screw for each hinge on the top and bottom of the door. After loosing the screws open the doors and ensure that they lie flat against the frame. You can adjust the screw to raise the door if the doors are sliding. This will prevent the doors from rubbing on the floor and allow them to shut correctly.\n\nIf the issue persists, you can also try raising the doors by altering the pivot pin at the bottom or guide wheel. Be cautious not to over tighten the wheels, or you may cause damage to the hardware.\n\nYou may also find that the hinges are cracked in the wood that they attach to the door. This can occur due to the normal wear and tear over time or changes in humidity. This issue can be fixed by applying carpenter's adsorbent to the cracks and then clamping them for 3-4 hours using C-clamps. Then screw the pivot pin and anchor back in place, and tighten the screws.\n\nAnother issue with bifold doors is that they slide open or close when the door is closed. This is usually caused by a spring in the top center stop, which is mounted by a spring. This is rubbing against the floor or frame and pushes the door open. This is a simple fix that is accomplished by loosing the set screw of the bracket that holds the stop and then moving it up or down about quarter of an inch.\n\nDebris on the Track\n\nThis is a simple one but many homeowners do not realize that the track of their bifold doors could become blocked by debris. Keep the tracks clean. This is particularly important in the autumn and winter, when road salt, dead leaves and other toxic substances are more likely to get dragged along the bottom of the door. This could cause the wheel to become stuck and stop the door from closing or opening.\n\nIn addition to keeping the track clean, it's essential to regularly oil the rail. This will ensure that the hinges and trolleys move smoothly along the track.\n\nIt is essential to use only silicone-based products for your bifold doors. This will prevent any damage from abrasive chemical that could damage the surface. It is also recommended to keep kids and pets away from areas where cleaning products are being used, as they can often give off toxic fumes.\n\nThe squeaking sound that is heard when bifold doors are shut or opened is a common issue. This is a sign that there's something getting stuck in the mechanism or tracks. It's important to clean these parts and investigate the cause.\n\nYou might want to employ a professional if you are not confident in cleaning and lubricating your bifold doors. They'll be able to identify any issues you might not have noticed, and ensure that your bifold doors function properly for many years. It's important to remember that investing in regular maintenance and catching issues early can save you money over the long term by avoiding costly repairs. For more details on how to care for your Origin bifold doors, get in touch with us today. We are happy to offer guidance and assistance, so you can enjoy the beauty of your new home improvement as long as you can.\n\nLack of Alignment\n\nIf bifold doors aren't aligned correctly this can cause the door to get stuck or jammed. This can also cause the panels to rattle in the breeze, or allow drafts. This is often caused by loose hinge screws. Letting them loose will allow you to adjust the hinges to a proper position. Once this is done the door should be able to open and close easily.\n\nWhen bifold doors are opened or closed, they can make the sound of scraping. It is usually due to with debris or something that is hard in the running track or the hinges. This is easily fixable by simply cleaning out the mechanism and lubricating it with a specialized spray or oil that is suitable for locks.\n\nThere may be a need to adjust the height.

Known for its lossless or minimal compression, TIFF is ideal for retaining every detail in high-resolution images, making it perfect for professional applications.\n\n### Key Benefits of TIFF\n\n**\\- High-Quality, Lossless Compression:** TIFF files are either uncompressed or minimally compressed, preserving every detail and nuance in the image, making it ideal for high-quality graphics and photos.\n\n**\\- Wide Color Range:** TIFF supports a large color depth, allowing for smooth gradients and true-to-life colors, which is crucial for detailed images like professional photography or artwork.\n\n**\\- Multiple Layers and Pages:** TIFF can store multiple layers within a single file, making it flexible for complex designs and multi-page documents, such as scanned documents and digital portfolios.\n\n**\\- Ideal for Print:** Due to its high resolution, TIFF is the preferred choice for print applications where detail and quality are critical.\n\nHowever, TIFF files are large and may not be practical for web use or easy sharing. This is where JPG can be a more efficient alternative, especially for web-based or storage-limited applications.\n\n## What is JPG?\n\nJPG, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), is one of the most widely used image formats for digital photography and online media. Known for its efficient lossy compression, JPG provides a balance of quality and smaller file sizes, making it ideal for web and email applications.\n\n### Key Benefits of JPG\n\n**\\- Efficient Compression:** JPG compresses images by discarding some data, reducing file sizes significantly while maintaining quality sufficient for most applications.\n\n**\\- Universal Compatibility:** JPG is supported on virtually all devices, applications, and web browsers, making it a highly versatile choice for sharing and displaying images.\n\n**\\- Adjustable Quality Settings:** JPG allows you to adjust compression levels, providing control over the balance between quality and file size, which is helpful for different use cases.\n\n**\\- Optimized for Web Use:** JPG’s small file size makes it ideal for online use, where quick loading times are essential for a positive user experience.\n\nWhile JPG’s compression makes it suitable for most digital uses, it is not ideal for high-resolution applications that require absolute fidelity. However, it’s a practical choice for images that need to be easily shared, displayed online, or saved in smaller file sizes.\n\n## Why Convert TIFF to JPG?\n\nConverting TIFF files to JPG can offer several advantages, particularly for applications where storage, compatibility, and speed are priorities. Here’s why you might consider converting [TIFF to JPG](https://cloudinary.com/tools/tiff-to-jpg):\n\n**\\- Reducing File Size for Storage and Web Use:** TIFF files are often large, and converting them to JPG significantly reduces file size, making images easier to store and share without consuming excessive storage space.\n\n**\\- Enhancing Compatibility Across Platforms:** JPG is widely supported on virtually all devices and applications, making it ideal for sharing images across different platforms. Converting TIFF files to JPG ensures compatibility with more viewers and software.\n\n**\\- Optimizing for Faster Load Times:** JPG’s smaller file size results in quicker loading times, making it the preferred format for web pages and email, where speed and accessibility are essential.\n\n**\\- Maintaining Visual Quality for General Viewing:** While TIFF is ideal for high-quality applications, JPG provides excellent visual quality suitable for everyday uses, such as online displays and personal photo albums.\n\n## When to Use JPG Over TIFF\n\nJPG is a practical choice for specific scenarios where storage, speed, and compatibility are more important than preserving every detail. Here’s when JPG might be more beneficial:\n\n**\\- Web-Friendly Photography:** For online photo galleries or e-commerce sites, JPG’s compression allows for high-quality images that load quickly and display consistently across devices.\n\n**\\- Social Media and Email Sharing:** JPG’s small file size and universal compatibility make it perfect for sharing images on social media or through email, ensuring your photos load quickly and display correctly.\n\n**\\- General Image Viewing and Storage:** For personal photo libraries or digital archives where high-resolution detail isn’t essential, JPG offers a manageable file size with good visual quality.\n\n**\\- Mobile and Web Applications:** JPG’s lightweight format is perfect for mobile devices and web applications where smaller file sizes improve speed and user experience.\n\n## Limitations of Converting TIFF to JPG\n\nWhile JPG offers several benefits, converting TIFF to JPG does come with some trade-offs:\n\n**\\- Loss of Detail:** JPG uses lossy compression, which discards some image data and detail. This may be noticeable in images with fine details or subtle color gradients, where quality is critical.\n\n**\\- No Support for Layers:** TIFF files can contain multiple layers, which are flattened during conversion to JPG. If your TIFF file includes layers for editing, converting to JPG will remove this flexibility.\n\n**\\- Reduced Print Quality:** JPG’s lossy compression makes it less suitable for professional print applications. If you need high resolution for printing, retaining the original TIFF file is advisable.\n\n## Tips for Converting TIFF to JPG\n\nIf you’re ready to convert TIFF files to JPG, here are some tips to help you achieve the best results:\n\n\\*\\*\n\n- Adjust Compression for Quality:\\*\\* When converting, set the compression level to find the right balance between file size and quality. For web use, higher compression may be acceptable, while lower compression is ideal for retaining more detail.\n**\\- Keep a Copy of the Original TIFF:** Since JPG is lossy, it’s best to keep the original TIFF file if you anticipate needing a high-resolution version or making future edits.\n**\\- Set the Appropriate Resolution:** Choose a resolution that fits your intended use. For web display, 72 DPI is typical, while higher DPI settings are better suited for larger displays or printing.\n**\\- Test Image Quality Post-Conversion:** After converting to JPG, examine the image for any loss in quality, especially in areas with gradients or detailed textures, to ensure it meets your needs.\n\n## Common Use Cases for JPG\n\nJPG’s versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, especially where quality and file size need to be balanced. Here are some common scenarios:\n\n**\\- Web and Mobile Content:** For website graphics, blog images, and social media, JPG’s small file size and efficient compression make it the best choice for quick loading and good visual quality.\n\n**\\- Photo Albums and Digital Archives:** For storing personal photos or creating digital albums, JPG offers a manageable file size without compromising too much on quality, making it ideal for large collections.\n\n**\\- Email Attachments and Sharing:** JPG’s compatibility and small size make it easy to share via email or text, allowing for seamless viewing across different devices.\n\n**\\- Image-Rich E-commerce Sites:** For product images, lifestyle photos, and catalog pages, JPG’s high quality and quick load times enhance the user experience and help boost engagement.\n\n## Conclusion: When to Convert TIFF to JPG\n\nConverting TIFF to JPG is beneficial when storage efficiency, quick load times, and compatibility are more important than high-resolution detail. JPG provides a good balance between quality and file size, making it an excellent choice for digital images that need to be shared, displayed online, or stored without taking up too much space.\n\nIn summary, while TIFF is invaluable for high-quality images that require precision and detail, JPG is the preferred format for general viewing, web use, and sharing.

Shelves upon shelves of books surround you, each one containing valuable information. But finding the specific book you're looking for? That’s where the librarian (or **SQL**) comes in. SQL is the magical language we use to ask questions in the “library” of data, making it simple to find, organize, and manage what we need. Ready to meet SQL and its useful tricks? Let’s dive in!\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. What is SQL and Why is it Important?\n\nThink of SQL as the “Google” for databases. Just like you type questions into Google and get answers, SQL lets us “ask” questions in databases, which are giant digital filing cabinets full of data. Every time you scroll through a social media feed, SQL is working behind the scenes to retrieve posts just for you!\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Basic SQL Commands: Meet the Fab Four (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)\n\nSQL commands are like special moves in a game, each one unlocking a new ability. Here are the four core moves every SQL beginner should know.\n\n#### a. SELECT - The Search Spell\n\nImagine you’re in a bookstore looking for all science fiction novels. The **SELECT** command is like using a search spell to find exactly what you want—no more, no less.\n\n```\n\nsql\nSELECT title, author FROM Books WHERE genre = 'Science Fiction';\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Its goal is to detect potential security flaws that could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.\n\n**_This is part of a series of articles about_** [**_application security testing._**](**_https://www.pynt.io/learning-hub/application-security-testing-guide/application-security-testing_**)\n\nWebsite security testing typically involves several testing techniques to simulate cyber-attacks and evaluate the security measures in place. By identifying these weak points, organizations can implement strategies to prevent exploitation and ensure the integrity of their web applications.\n\nWith cybersecurity threats constantly evolving, regular security evaluations help organizations keep up with potential risks. Security testing involves a mix of manual and automated processes that target various components of a web application, including its code, network, and user interface.\n\n**_Read the full article:_** **_[https://www.pynt.io/learning-hub/application-security-testing-guide/web-security-testing-approaches-tools-and-methodology](https://www.pynt.io/learning-hub/application-security-testing-guide/web-security-testing-approaches-tools-and-methodology)_**\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

As with all doors, they will need some attention over time.\n\nIf they are beginning to sag, scrape or jump from their brackets you can make three simple adjustments to bring your doors back on track.\n\nSagging\n\nOver time, bifold doors may experience a number of issues. Some of these problems include noise or sagging, or even the door falling off its track. This doesn't always need to be a major issue and can usually be fixed easily.\n\nIf your bifold doors seem to be sagging or are falling off their track, you can tighten the hinge bolts. You can find the ideal balance by loosening the hinge bolt, then extending it and pushing it back into the door to lower the doors.\n\nYou can also find out if there is anything stuck in the track. If there's debris on the track, like gravel or sand, or even stones that are buried therein, the doors could fall out of position. If the track is not cleaned properly, it can get dirty and corrosive over time.\n\nAnother issue that could arise is that the hinges that hold the doors in place may require adjustment or lubrication. If this is the case, it is recommended to consult an expert to repair your bifold doors, since they'll require special tools.\n\nOne of the main problems associated with uPVC bifold doors is that they can become noisy over time. This is caused by various factors such as the track not being aligned properly and worn-out rollers creating friction when closing and opening the doors. Start by tightening the hinges that are loose. This will help reduce noise.\n\nIf this doesn't solve the problem then you can spray some silicon-based lubricant on the tracks. You can reduce noise by sliding the doors across the lubricant. You can also replace any old rollers that are damaged or worn out. This is a drastic option that should only be used in the case of a last resort. Follow these guidelines to keep your uPVC Bifold doors in good condition for a long time.\n\nJumping\n\nThe great thing about bifold doors is that they're flexible and can be modified to meet virtually any need. They are popular for connecting and opening living spaces. They can also be used as closet doors or front doors. However, as with all doors, they can suffer from some issues. These problems are usually easy to fix.\n\nFor example, if you have bifold doors that don't close properly, the problem may be due to something as simple as a faulty hinge. It could be something that is as small as an item wedged in the seal of the door, or a gap in the track or hinges. The first step is to look over the doors and attempt to identify any obstructions. You can also close the doors both ways to hear if there is any rattling. If the doors are rattling, it is likely that they need to be cleaned or lubricated.\n\nAnother issue that is common to these doors is that they can start to jump or drop off the tracks. This is usually a sign that your doors aren't aligned with the track, and it's possible to fix this by altering the hinges. It could be necessary to clean the tracks of the doors and the rollers or hinges need to be replaced.\n\nIf the problem persists it is worthwhile to contact an expert to conduct an examination of the hinges and track. The door may have swelled in the heat and could be pulling on the hinges. In this case it's recommended to replace the hinges and rollers to ensure that the doors will work properly.\n\nFinally, it is also a good idea to check that the pivot bracket on the bottom is in the correct position on the floor. If it is too low, or is buried beneath carpet You may have to raise it by using height screws.\n\nBifold doors are efficient and space-saving, but they may have issues which need to be resolved as soon as is possible.

Known for its lossless compression, TIFF preserves all image data, making it an ideal choice for projects where quality and detail are essential.\n\n### Key Benefits of TIFF\n\n**\\- High-Resolution Quality:** TIFF files are typically uncompressed or use lossless compression, preserving every pixel of detail, which is ideal for high-resolution images and professional editing.\n\n**\\- Support for Layers and Pages:** TIFF can store multiple layers or pages within a single file, useful for design projects that require layered compositions.\n\n**\\- Wide Color Depth:** TIFF supports a high color depth, making it suitable for images with detailed color gradients, smooth transitions, and high fidelity.\n\n**\\- Print-Ready Format:** Due to its quality retention, TIFF is often preferred for print projects where high resolution is critical.\n\nHowever, TIFF files can be very large, which limits their practicality for web use or when storage and loading speed are a priority. WebP offers a web-friendly alternative that compresses images without sacrificing quality.\n\n## What is WebP?\n\nWebP is an image format created to improve website performance by offering high-quality images with small file sizes. By combining lossy and lossless compression, WebP reduces file size while maintaining visual quality, making it a practical choice for digital applications where loading speed and storage efficiency are essential.\n\n### Key Benefits of WebP\n\n**\\- Efficient Compression:** WebP images are often 25-35% smaller in size than JPG or PNG files, which significantly reduces page load times and improves web performance.\n\n**\\- Lossy and Lossless Options:** WebP supports both lossy and lossless compression, allowing flexibility for users to choose quality or file size based on specific needs.\n\n**\\- Transparency and Animation:** Like PNG and GIF, WebP supports transparency and can handle simple animations, making it versatile for both static and animated graphics.\n\n**\\- Optimized for Web:** WebP’s small file size and high quality make it ideal for web images, helping to improve SEO and user experience by reducing load times.\n\nWhile WebP is great for web-based projects, it’s not always the best choice for high-resolution images intended for printing or extensive editing, where TIFF’s lossless quality and large color depth may be more appropriate.\n\n## Why Convert TIFF to WebP?\n\nThere are specific scenarios where converting TIFF files to WebP is beneficial, especially for online use and storage efficiency:\n\n**\\- Optimizing High-Quality Images for the Web:** TIFF files are typically large and not optimized for the web. Converting TIFF to WebP allows you to retain high-quality visuals while reducing file size, making images easier to load on web pages.\n\n**\\- Reducing Storage Requirements:** TIFF files take up substantial storage space. Converting them to WebP reduces file size without significant quality loss, which is particularly useful for image-heavy websites or projects with limited storage.\n\n**\\- Improving Website Performance:** WebP’s efficient compression enhances load times and overall performance, which is beneficial for user experience and search engine optimization.\n\n**\\- Compatibility Across Modern Platforms:** WebP is compatible with most modern web browsers and applications, ensuring that your images display consistently for a wide audience.\n\n## When to Use WebP Over TIFF\n\nWhile TIFF is valuable for professional-quality, high-resolution images, WebP is ideal for scenarios where quality and efficiency are both important. Here are some situations where WebP may be the better option:\n\n**\\- Web-Optimized Photography and Graphics:** For websites that showcase high-quality photos, converting [TIFF to WebP](https://cloudinary.com/tools/tiff-to-webp) helps reduce file size without sacrificing too much detail, allowing for a faster and more efficient web experience.\n\n**\\- E-Commerce Product Images:** WebP’s small file sizes make it suitable for e-commerce, where fast-loading images are essential to keep customers engaged.\n\n**\\- Responsive Web Design:** WebP images are optimized for web responsiveness, providing quality images that load quickly and look great on devices of all sizes.\n\n**\\- Media-Rich Blogs and Content-Heavy Websites:** For blogs and websites with a lot of images, converting TIFF files to WebP helps manage bandwidth and server load while maintaining good visual quality.\n\n## Limitations of Converting TIFF to WebP\n\nWhile WebP offers numerous advantages for web use, converting TIFF to WebP may involve a few trade-offs:\n\n**\\- Loss of Original Detail:** While WebP preserves quality well, converting from a lossless TIFF to a lossy WebP may result in a slight loss of detail, which could be noticeable in highly detailed images.\n\n**\\- Limited Editability:** TIFF files can contain multiple layers and pages, making them easy to edit and ideal for professional design projects. Converting to WebP will flatten these layers, making further edits challenging.\n\n**\\- Color Depth Reduction:** WebP’s color depth is suitable for the web but may not capture the full depth and fidelity of TIFF files, particularly for images with complex color gradients.\n\n## Tips for Converting TIFF to WebP\n\nIf you’ve decided to convert TIFF files to WebP, here are some tips to ensure the best quality and efficiency:\n\n**\\- Choose Appropriate Compression Settings:** WebP offers both lossy and lossless compression. For images where quality is critical, select lossless; for web use, lossy compression may provide better file size reduction.\n\n**\\- Set the Right Resolution:** Since WebP is pixel-based, choose an appropriate resolution for your display needs. Higher resolutions work better for larger displays but result in bigger file sizes.\n\n**\\- Keep Original Files for Future Edits:** Once converted, WebP files are not as editable as TIFF files. Retain a copy of the original TIFF for any future editing needs or adjustments.\n\n**\\- Test on Different Devices:** While WebP is supported by most modern browsers, it’s always a good idea to test your converted images on various devices to ensure consistent quality and compatibility.\n\n## Common Use Cases for WebP\n\nWebP is highly effective in scenarios where quality, performance, and efficiency are priorities. Here are a few practical applications:\n\n**\\- Website Photography and Digital Art:** For sites that showcase high-quality photos or art, WebP delivers a good balance between quality and loading speed.\n\n**\\- Product and Lifestyle Images for E-Commerce:** E-commerce platforms benefit from WebP’s small file sizes, which reduce load times for product images and improve user experience.\n\n**\\- Content-Heavy Websites and Blogs:** Blogs and media-heavy websites can reduce server load and improve page speed by converting large images to WebP.\n\n**\\- Visual Content for SEO:** With its small file size, WebP images can improve page load speed, which can boost SEO rankings and enhance the user experience.\n\n## Conclusion: When to Convert TIFF to WebP\n\nConverting TIFF to WebP can be advantageous when file efficiency, quality, and compatibility are more important than retaining full detail. WebP is an excellent choice for websites and applications where loading speed and small file sizes are essential. However, TIFF remains the preferred choice for high-resolution printing, archival, and professional editing, where every detail matters.\n\nIn summary, both TIFF and WebP offer unique strengths: TIFF for high-resolution, professional-quality images and WebP for efficient, high-quality images optimized for the web. By understanding each format’s advantages, you can make informed decisions that optimize your images for the best quality, speed, and performance across platforms.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Here's a quick rundown of the pros and cons of switching to a passkey-only system. 🔐\n\n[![google passkey](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3k2edw4mr9c8qhmn5p9n.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3k2edw4mr9c8qhmn5p9n.png)\n\n* * *\n\n**🔹 Quick Overview of Passkeys**\n\nPasskeys, aka WebAuthn credentials, are secure, public-key-based authentication credentials designed to replace passwords and make logging in both easier and safer. They let you log in to apps and websites without needing a password by using biometrics like Face ID, Touch ID, or a device PIN. 💻\n\n* * *\n\n**✅ Benefits of Passkey-Only Systems**\n\n**1\\. Superior Security**\n\n- 🛡️ Since passkeys are tied to specific websites, they’re a inherently defensive against **phishing**.\n- 🔒 No more weak or reused passwords, and database breaches have less impact.\n\n**2\\. Smooth User Experience**\n\n- 🧠 Users don’t need to create, remember, or manage passwords.\n- ⚡ Log in with a quick biometric scan or PIN.\n\n**3\\. Low Support Costs**\n\n- 💸 Fewer Password Resets: No more forgotten passwords to reset!\n- 🔄 Simplified Account Recovery: Account recovery can be managed through the user’s device or platform account.\n\n**4\\. Cross-Platform friendly**\n\n- 📲 Passkeys can sync across devices seamlessly on many platforms.\n- 🌐 Works on different operating systems and browsers supporting WebAuthn.\n\n* * *\n\n**❌ Drawbacks of Passkey-Only Login Systems**\n\n**1\\. Low User Adoption Trend**\n\n- 📚 Many users are still new to passkeys, so some guidance may be needed.\n- 🌍 Not all browsers or platforms support passkeys yet.\n\n**2\\. Device Dependent**\n\n- 📱 If a user loses access to their device, \\*\\*recovery \\*\\*might be tricky.\n- 🚚 Moving passkeys to a new device can be a bit of a hassle.\n\n**3\\. Complex to Implement**\n\n- 🛠️ Developers need to make substantial changes to **backend authentication**.\n- 🌐 Different device capabilities mean extra work to ensure fallback options.\n\n**4\\. Lock-In Risk**\n\n- 🔒 Some users might feel locked into specific \\*\\*ecosystem \\*\\*providers like Apple or Google.\n- 🔍 Passkey management by these platforms can raise **privacy** concerns.\n\n* * *\n\n**🎉 Wrapping Up**\n\nPasskey-only login systems offer a lot of advantages in terms of security, ease of use, and support savings. However, challenges with adoption, implementation, and platform dependency remain. As the tech evolves, many of these challenges may get easier. For developers interested in implementing passkeys, it's best to offer clear user instructions, create strong fallback options, and consider a phased approach that combines passkeys with traditional logins. 🚀\n\n**🔒 Complete Authentication and User Management solution**\n\nIf you’re looking for a complete management solution, Hanko should be your go to choice. You can integrate from passwords all the way to passkeys, 2FA, and SSO. (MFA coming in Oct).\n\nThe best part is it’s Open-source. You can checkout their [Github](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko).

A doctor can evaluate the mood of a person, their medical history, and the presence of any comorbid conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as anxiety or depression.\n\nA structured interview is an essential part of an evaluation. Interviews with family members, coworkers and friends are possible to gain an understanding of the person's past.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAdults who suffer from ADHD might experience many of the same symptoms as children, but the behaviors they exhibit can affect different areas of their lives. They may have difficulty keeping their jobs, coordinating relationships, and do well in school, for example. The signs include trouble paying attention to the present, frequent interruptions or uttering answers in a blur and not being able to follow the instructions of work and repeatedly ignoring appointments. The condition can also cause financial challenges since people are more likely to make mistakes that are not considered prudent or overspend.\n\nadhd diagnosis uk can evaluate adults for ADHD by using different methods. They can interview parents and ask them to talk about their childhood experiences. They can also review their the report cards and take note of comments from teachers. Interviewing family members, friends and colleagues can be used to determine the performance of an individual. They can even use online ratings or self-tests.\n\nAdults are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD when they have experienced 5 out of 9 symptoms in the last six months. The symptoms are present in multiple contexts and cannot be explained by a mental health issue such as an anxiety or mood disorder or other physical issues like visual or hearing loss.\n\nIf you're diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, it's normal to experience a range of emotions. It can be a great relief when you finally discover an explanation for the challenges you've faced for a long time. It can also be a bit upsetting to discover that you suffer from an illness of the mind, especially when you've had success in other aspects of your life.\n\nA person diagnosed with ADHD will typically receive medication, psychotherapy or other treatments. In some cases, doctors will recommend accommodations for work or daily activities. Accommodations are the tools or modifications to the environment of a person that help them succeed and minimize the effects of their disability. Examples include the use of a step stool for those who is shorter than average or computer programs that allow people with vision limitations to focus on the screen. Adult ADHD is usually treated with behavioral therapy.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nIf you suspect that you might have ADHD, the first step is to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Consult your primary care physician or a mental health professional to refer you to a specialist that performs ADHD assessments. Your doctor will conduct an interview with you and will review your medical, family and personal background. Your doctor will also ask about your health issues and how they impact your life at school, at work and at home.\n\nYour doctor will apply the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic guidelines included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), to determine if you meet the criteria for ADHD. The following are some of the DSM-5 criteria for inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive types of ADHD:\n\nInattention: Has difficulty staying focused on tasks or activities for long periods of time. Trouble finishing chores, tasks or schoolwork. Many times, they make errors at work, school or in leisure activities. is easily distracted by others or everyday activities. Often, they daydream, appear to be on autopilot, or loses their focus on what they are doing.\n\nHyperactivity/Impulsivity: Often restless, fidgets or can't sit still in class or at work. Frequently interrupts others or talks in a non-linear manner. Frequently gets bored quickly and is in search of excitement or a new experience. In most cases, they engage in fights or disputes without considering the consequences.\n\nOften, people with inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive type ADHD have coexisting conditions such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, learning disabilities and other mental illnesses. These conditions can have their impacts on a person and can complicate the diagnosis.\n\nA physical exam is conducted to determine if there are medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders and seizure disorders, may mimic ADHD symptoms.\n\nIf your symptoms are serious If your symptoms are severe, additional neuropsychological, psychological and/or learning disabilities testing may be performed to aid in making the diagnosis. These tests can provide vital information on the ways in how your ADHD affects your functioning and relationships. They can also help identify any other underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe same methods that children with ADHD receive - medications, behavior strategies training in life skills, and therapy -- usually are effective for adults too. Adults may need to try different medications since the ones they took as children might not be appropriate for them at the moment.\n\nA specialist in ADHD should be sought out by those suffering from ADHD. This could be a primary physician who treats ADHD regularly or a mental healthcare professional such as psychologist or psychiatrist. Many insurance plans offer online directories of specialists. Additionally, a local support group for people with ADHD or an expert in mood disorders may be able to recommend the services of a specialist.\n\nAfter the examination the doctor should then identify the cause and prescribe treatment. They will be looking to speak with the person about their history, especially how the symptoms affected them during childhood. diagnosis adhd may suggest couples' or family therapy if the individual struggles with their career or in their relationships.\n\nMost people suffering from ADHD can be effectively treated through medication. These are usually small, fast-acting drugs that reduce the chemical imbalance that is the cause of ADHD. In many instances, a doctor will also prescribe other treatments for related disorders such as depression or anxiety.\n\nBehavioral therapy can help solve issues with time management and organization, impulse control, and emotional self-regulation. Therapists who specialize in working with people with ADHD can offer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as well as other customized interventions.\n\nMany adults suffering from ADHD are relieved when they are finally diagnosed. The right treatment plan can transform their lives to the better. They can become more productive at work, be successful at school or develop more satisfying and healthier relationships. Many people are pleased to finally receive a diagnosis after years regrets over mistakes made because their symptoms were not properly diagnosed or treated. It is possible that a person's behavior was influenced by gender identity, race, and socioeconomic circumstances.\n\nSupport\n\nIf you weren't diagnosed with ADHD as a child, it's not too late to seek an assessment and treatment. Many professionals are trained in ADHD and can tell you whether your symptoms are mild, moderate, or severe. They can also rule out other mental health issues or physical ailments, as well as stress as the reason for your symptoms.\n\nA diagnosis of ADHD may bring up complex feelings, such as sadness over missed opportunities or relief that you now have a solid explanation for your difficulties. Adults who suffer from ADHD often feel that they are being judged by other people for behaviors that aren't their own fault, such as the inability to keep their work organized. They may also have financial issues, like the late payment deadlines or a the burden of debt from impulse purchases.\n\nIt's not unusual for adults with ADHD to experience self-destructive behaviors like drug and alcohol abuse, inadequate nutrition, chronic stress and tension, low self-esteem, or issues with their relationships with family members and friends. Additionally, they could be struggling with their physical health. They may neglect vital checkups or medications or struggle to follow medical instructions. They may have trouble managing their finances and keeping their jobs because they aren't organized, do not meet corporate expectations and cannot follow a routine or schedule.\n\nAdults suffering from ADHD might benefit from support groups or therapy that offer strategies and techniques to live with the disorder. Specialist ADHD therapists can assist adults manage their symptoms, compensate for their weaknesses and improve their performance in life. They can also collaborate with family members in discussing how the disorder affects their relationship, and come up with strategies to support their loved one.\n\nOnline communities and peer support are also useful. Sites like Sheila Henson and Neuroqueer offer individual and group coaching, workshops and webinars on organizing skills, emotional regulation, and social interaction. Other online sources include ADHD accommodating workplace accommodations, restaurants, and classes to improve communication.\n\nSome people with ADHD find it beneficial to join support groups.

I am keeping it simple as much as I can.\n\n* * *\n\n# Setting Up a GitLab CI Pipeline for Security Scanning\n\nContinuous Integration (CI) pipelines play a critical role in automating and securing code development workflows. With GitLab CI, you can automate security scans to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your code. In this guide, we’ll set up a CI pipeline in GitLab using Trivy, a popular open-source security scanner ( [https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)), to perform file system scans for configuration issues and vulnerabilities.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. **GitLab Repository**: You’ll need a GitLab project to set up your CI/CD pipeline.\n2. **GitLab Runner**: Make sure you have a GitLab Runner available to execute the pipeline jobs.\n\n## Step 1: Create the `.gitlab-ci.yml` File\n\nIn the root of your GitLab project, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. This file defines the stages, jobs, and configuration for your CI/CD pipeline.\n\nHere's the `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration for our Trivy security scan job:\n\n```\nsecurity-misc-scan:\n  stage: security_scan\n  variables:\n    TRIVY_NO_PROGRESS: \"true\" # Disables the progress bar for a cleaner log output\n    TRIVY_CACHE_DIR: \".trivycache/\" # Sets the directory for caching scan data\n  before_script:\n    - apt-get update; apt-get install curl -y; # Install curl to retrieve the latest Trivy version\n    - export TRIVY_VERSION=$(curl -s \"https://api.github.com/repos/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/latest\" | grep '\"tag_name\":' | sed -E 's/.*\"v([^\"]+)\".*/\\1/') # Fetch the latest Trivy version\n    - echo $TRIVY_VERSION\n    - curl -L https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/download/v${TRIVY_VERSION}/trivy_${TRIVY_VERSION}_Linux-64bit.tar.gz | tar -zxvf - # Download and extract Trivy\n  script:\n    - touch misc-scan-report.json # Create a file to store the scan results\n    - ./trivy filesystem --scanners config,vuln --exit-code 0 --format template --template \"@contrib/gitlab-codequality.tpl\" -o misc-scan-report.json . # Run Trivy with config and vulnerability scanners\n    - cat misc-scan-report.json # Display the report in the job log\n  cache:\n    paths:\n      - .trivycache/ # Cache directory to save data between pipeline runs\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n      - misc-scan-report.json # Save the scan report as an artifact\n    reports:\n      codequality: misc-scan-report.json # Report for GitLab Code Quality\n  when: always # Always run this job\n  rules:\n  - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == \"parent_pipeline\" # Run the job only if the pipeline source is parent_pipeline\n  allow_failure: true # Allow this job to fail without impacting the pipeline status\n  tags:\n  - dind # Runner tag for Docker-in-Docker\n  needs: []\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n### Explanation of the Job Configuration\n\n1. **Stage**: `security_scan` defines the stage in the pipeline where this job will run.\n2. **Variables**: Trivy environment variables are defined for better output and caching.\n3. **Before Script**: This section downloads and installs Trivy. It fetches the latest release version from GitHub, ensuring the scan uses the most recent updates.\n4. **Script**: Runs the Trivy scan on the repository files and generates a JSON report file `misc-scan-report.json`.\n5. **Cache**: Caches the `.trivycache/` directory to speed up scans by reusing downloaded data between jobs.\n6. **Artifacts**: Stores the JSON report for later review. GitLab can use this report for Code Quality integration.\n7. **Rules**: Ensures the job runs only if triggered by a parent pipeline.\n8. **Tags**: Specifies the runner requirements, in this case, a `dind` (Docker-in-Docker) compatible runner. You need to change it to the tag of your Gitlab runners.\n\n## Step 2: Commit and Push Your `.gitlab-ci.yml` File\n\nAfter creating the file, commit and push it to your GitLab repository:\n\n```\ngit add .gitlab-ci.yml\ngit commit -m \"Add Trivy security scan job to CI pipeline\"\ngit push origin main\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n## Step 3: Monitor the Pipeline\n\nOnce pushed, GitLab will automatically trigger the pipeline. You can check the job logs to see Trivy’s progress and review the `misc-scan-report.json` output for any discovered vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.\n\nYou can check the full report at **Code Quality tab** in **Gitlab Pipelines** page:\n\n[![Image description](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fw067kc2uklz6ijer1k1g.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fw067kc2uklz6ijer1k1g.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, you’ve set up a GitLab CI pipeline that automates security scanning with Trivy, enhancing your project’s security without manual intervention. This approach keeps your codebase secure and compliant, helping you catch potential issues early in the development process.\n\nLet me know if you’d like further customization options for different scan configurations!\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

They can also be programmed to let your cat to leave at specific times of the day. This is useful for those who don't want their pet to become stressed.\n\nA cat flap can make your home more secure and energy efficient. Installing one could be expensive if you do not know what to look for.\n\nCost of the flap\n\nInstalling a cat flap is a great idea if you own a pet cat. This will allow your pet to go outside whenever they want, and come back in when you are ready. It will also lower their stress levels and make your life much easier. It will also prevent your cat from getting in trouble with other cats and dogs.\n\nThe cost of installing a cat flap will depend on the kind of flap you choose and the material of the door or wall. Standard pet flaps are less expensive than those with lockable cat flaps or features like microchip access. There are many types of pet flaps available, so you should choose one that is suitable for your requirements and the needs of your pets.\n\nThe size of the pet flap needs to be taken into consideration when selecting a type. You should purchase a pet flap that is big enough for your pet to fit comfortably through. This will prevent accidents and injury. Additionally, you should determine your cat's height and width prior to buying a pet flap.\n\nThe installation of a cat flap can be quite complicated, especially if the surface is difficult to cut into. It is more expensive to install a pet flap on a door that has a harder surface, like glass or uPVC. Additionally, the area of your home will also impact the cost of labor. You'll pay more in London for an expert installer to put in a cat door than the North of England.\n\nThe price of a cat flap is usually lower on websites such as eBay or Amazon than on the official website of the brand. It is essential to read reviews prior buying the product to ensure that you're getting the highest quality. It is also recommended to look over the product's description to know what each model has to offer. You can even try a few models that are similar to determine which one your pet likes better.\n\nInstallation costs\n\nA cat flap can improve your pet's quality of life by permitting him to leave and enter the house whenever he wants. It can also keep them safe and reduce stress within the home. The process of installing it can be costly. A professional cat flap fitter can install a brand new cat flap for a reasonable cost. It is important to hire a professional in order to ensure that the flap is fitted correctly. A poorly fitted cat flap could allow drafts into your home and provide an entry point for unwanted guests.\n\nThe cost of the installation process will vary based on the kind of pet flap used and the surface it is being installed into. An easy installation on a wooden door can cost around PS80, while an installation that is more complex an external wall or French glass door could cost as high as PS250. The total cost of labour will be affected by the size of the pet flap, and whether or not it is equipped with an locking mechanism.\n\nIt is advisable to measure your pet's size before you begin the process to ensure that it will fit through the door for your pet. This will ensure that you don't end up buying a cat-flap that is too small and can be uncomfortable for the pet. Also, avoid cutting holes into the walls of your house without the assistance of a professional. This could lead to a range of problems, such as damage to electrical cables and pipework, instability of the wall structure, and leaks as well as weather damage from outside.\n\nIt is also recommended to utilize a pet flap which can detect microchips, as this can improve security and security. This type of cat flap requires an implanted microchip under your pet's skin, and is only opened by the proper code. To prevent accidental activation the microchip pet door should only be opened when the owner is home. This is a great method to prevent unwanted visitors from entering your home, and can make installation much easier.\n\nCost of the battery\n\nThe cat flap is a crucial safety measure for your home, however installing it can be expensive. There are many factors that impact the price of the flap, such as its dimensions and features. It is essential to pick the one that best suits your budget and home. You can pick from a manual model that is basic to a more advanced microchip or app-controlled one.\n\nA microchip cat door is a fantastic option to ensure your cat or kitten only enters and leaves the home through the door. However it can be expensive. There are a variety of kinds of microchip pet flaps, so you need to think about the features that are important to you. It is also recommended to seek expert advice to help you make the right choice.\n\nIf you have an active family of cats, a microchip cat flap with the option of a selective exit could be the best choice. This feature lets you decide the cats who can leave and when they are allowed to leave. It is a great option if you have older cats or kittens that require a safe and secure home. The lock mechanism reads the microchip or infrared detector that is on your cat's collar. This means that only your pet has access to your home.\n\nThe Sureflap DualScan Cat Flap is another option. It has an all-four-way locking mechanism, and an automatic timer. It also detects the FDX-B (15 digits) which is the most popular microchip that cats are implanted with. This cat flap has been rated as easy to program and well-functioning by pet owners. It also has a weatherproof seal to stop rain and wind from entering your home.\n\nThis electronic cat flap is designed to be used by up to nine cats and it uses ID discs that can be attached to the collar of the cat to identify them. It can only be hung on walls, not on doors. It is an easy and simple design, but it is not as secure as some of the other options on this list. It also makes a click sound when engaged and can be a bit frightening for pets with certain breeds.\n\nCost of the collar\n\nIf you're looking for an exciting new cat flap for your home, it's crucial to understand how much you can expect to spend. The price of the flap will vary depending on its size and type. A basic two-way pet flap can cost as low as PS10, while more advanced flaps can cost as high as PS250. It's important to also consider the surface that you're installing the pet flap onto, as some surfaces can be more difficult to cut than other surfaces.\n\nIf your cat flap doesn't function properly, you must replace it. A damaged flap could allow heat to escape your home and let other animals in. To prevent this from happening, you should install the collar of your cat with an escape latch. The collar will break at 5.5 pounds and will stop your cat from pulling the collar away, but not enough to hurt your cat.\n\nA cat collar is an excellent way to guard your pet and keep them safe while out on adventures. A collar that has an ID tag is the quickest method to help your pet get back home if they are lost. You can also put on fun charms or bells with a decorative design to give your pet a more personal touch.\n\nThis curved collar is made of durable, long-lasting PU leather and has a flexible buckle that is suitable for most cats. The collar comes in various colors and styles to suit the individuality of each cat. It is also light and comfortable so your cat can wear it for long periods of time.\n\nFor added security For extra security, you can select a pet flap with a microchip. This is more expensive than a traditional pet flap, but it offers an extra layer of protection from stray animals that enter your home. It is able to recognize the microchip of your cat and only allowing access if your pet has one. This is a great choice for those who want to keep your cat inside and out of your home at all times. A microchip-operated flap will also keep strays out of your home in bad weather.\n\n[cat flaps](https://algowiki.win/wiki/Post:Fitting_a_Cat_Flap)\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

They can also help stop your cat from urinating in the house.\n\nIt is easier to install a cat flap on a upvc panel than one made of glass however, you'll require some knowledge and right tools.\n\nTake a measurement of the door\n\nFitting a cat flap in the door can be a challenge however, as long as you select the right kind of cat flap be patient and follow the instructions provided it shouldn't be a problem. We will demonstrate how to draw the shape using an jigsaw to cut out the door area. Then we will finish the job by affixing the cat flap. This will ensure that the flap stays in position and protects the doors from damage caused by rain and wind.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is measure the width of your pet to get a precise measurement of what size of cat flap you will need. This will ensure that the flap is big enough to allow your pet to leave and enter the home without needing to open and close the door every time, but it is also small enough to keep them from moving too far in either direction.\n\nIf your kit has a drawing showing where to drill then you can stick it on the door, and then draw around it. If your door has a sill or moulding at the bottom, make sure that you leave enough space between your cat and these elements.\n\nSet a square to ensure that you're cutting correctly and to ensure the hole is a good rectangle shape. When you are satisfied with this, you are able to begin removing the rest of the door material. If you have a square that you have cut, make use of it to verify that you're cutting properly and also to ensure that the hole is in a rectangular shape. Once you are satisfied with this you can start to remove the remaining door material.\n\nDraw a Line\n\nThe cat flap is a great way to let your pet out and in without having to worry about them being in the house with guests or leaving unwanted gifts in the home. It also stops draughts and helps keep your home's temperature in check. Fitting a cat flap to your door might seem difficult to those who haven't tried it before. Many people call a professional joiner or carpenter to do the work. While this is certainly an option, it's possible to do the job yourself if you own the proper tools and follow instructions with care.\n\nWhile this is far easier to do with a timber door, it is still possible to do this in uPVC doors, but you must be careful to avoid damaging the doors as this will invalidate the warranty. The first step is to take measurements of the door to ensure that it can accommodate the new cat-flap. This should be easy enough when you have a standard uPVC door, but you may need to take more care if using an alternative type of door since these are more difficult to cut into than solid uPVC panels.\n\nThe next step is to determine the height of your belly for your cat. This is the amount of height between the floor and the bottom of your cat's stomach. You will need to locate a space at the entrance that allows your cat to move through easily. Once you have the information you'll have to mark the area with a spirit-level and a pencil so that you are sure that the opening will fit your cat.\n\nAfter you have marked the area, it is time to cut the hole. It is essential to be patient and use a jigsaw ensure that the cuts are smooth and clean not uneven and rough. This could cause damage to your door. Wear safety glasses and a dust mask when working with a jigsaw. Inhaling cat flap installation is hazardous for your health. Once you've finished cutting the hole, you'll need sandpaper to smooth the edges so that the cat flap can be easily inserted.\n\nMake a hole\n\nIt can be a challenge to install an animal flap on the door panel or double glazing unit. If you're not experienced in DIY, it's best to hire a professional to complete the work for you. A faulty job can not only be ugly and unattractive, but could also be security risks. It could let cold air to enter when the cat is outdoors and hot air to escape when the cat is inside.\n\nThe first thing you have to do is draw the position of the hole in the door using a pencil and a spirit level, this will ensure that it is placed and runs flush with all other parts of the door. Make sure you have an sandpaper piece on ready for any rough edges.\n\nOnce the line has been marked you should cut out the hole with the jigsaw. Remember to wear any necessary safety equipment for working with the power tool. If you are worried about the noise of a jigsaw you can buy an electric version that is quieter and simpler to use.\n\nIt is best to only remove the material required to fit the flap. It is essential to leave a bit of material for the wall thickness of the flap. However cutting off too much material can cause issues or even damage the door frame.\n\nIf cat flap install has a metal panel or frame, it may interfere with the microchip flap. In this scenario, you will need to make an oversize hole to ensure that the metal doesn't touch the wall of the flap.\n\nIf you're installing a cat flap into the frame of a double glazed window with a metal frame, you'll need to speak to a professional who will provide you with a brand new glass pane that already has the hole for the cat flap already drilled in it. It is cheaper to have this done than trying to fix the flap to an existing glass pane that was not designed specifically for the purpose.\n\nPlace the Flap\n\nCat flaps allow your pet to leave and come whenever they want, allowing them the ability to unwind inside the house whenever they want to. If you have an uPVC front door, it may be difficult to install a cat flap. This is especially true in the event that you don't own a glass panel that can be cut. If you're able to purchase and install a half-glazed replacement uPVC panel, then it's possible to add the cat flap to these doors. It's not as simple as simply cutting a hole in the door however, and there are a few things you'll need first to ensure that it's safe.\n\nA uPVC, GRP or composite door panel typically comprises a flimsy plastic outer skin joined to a soft polystyrene core that is insulating. It is essential to be careful when cutting the material. This kind of door typically comes with a template drawing that you can use as a guide for cutting the hole in your door.\n\nAfter you have marked out the opening in your front door, it's time to put in the cat flap. You can pick from a range of options, from simple push-button flaps to ones that are microchip-activated and only let your pet in. Whatever kind of cat flaps you choose, it's vital that your cat is able to use the flap without getting caught in the rain.\n\nIt's a good idea select a circular fitting rather than a square one, as circles can be more securely cut into door glass.

TIFF is commonly used in professional photography, desktop publishing, and document archiving due to its ability to retain fine detail and color fidelity.\n\n### Key Benefits of TIFF\n\n**\\- High-Quality and Lossless:** TIFF files are often uncompressed or use lossless compression, meaning that image quality remains intact, making it ideal for high-resolution images that need to retain every detail.\n\n**\\- Large Color Depth:** TIFF supports a high color depth, allowing for precise color reproduction and smooth gradients, which is important in professional photography, digital art, and archival purposes.\n\n**\\- Multiple Layers and Pages:** TIFF can store multiple layers or pages in a single file, which is beneficial for complex documents and design files where editing flexibility is necessary.\n\n**\\- Suitable for Print:** Due to its high quality, TIFF is often preferred for print projects, where detail and resolution are critical.\n\nHowever, TIFF files can be large in size, which makes them less practical for web use or applications where storage and speed are important. This is where GIF comes into play.\n\n## What is GIF?\n\nGIF, or Graphics Interchange Format, is a pixel-based format best known for its ability to create short, looping animations. GIFs use a limited color palette and are most suitable for graphics with fewer colors, such as icons, logos, and animations.\n\n### Key Benefits of GIF\n\n**\\- Simple Animation Support:** GIFs can create frame-by-frame animations, making them popular for social media reactions, memes, and other short, looping visuals.\n\n**\\- Universal Compatibility:** GIFs are widely supported across web browsers, devices, and platforms, making them easy to share and display anywhere.\n\n**\\- Efficient for Low-Color Graphics:** GIFs use a maximum of 256 colors, which keeps file sizes small, making them suitable for icons, buttons, and other simple graphics that don’t require high color depth.\n\n**\\- Transparency (Basic):** GIFs support basic transparency, which allows images to have simple clear backgrounds for icons or overlays.\n\nGIF’s strengths lie in web-based, animated content and low-color graphics, but its limited color range and compression method make it unsuitable for high-quality, detailed images like those stored in TIFF.\n\n## Why Convert TIFF to GIF?\n\nThere are specific scenarios where converting TIFF files to GIF is useful, particularly for creating simple, web-friendly visuals:\n\n**\\- Creating Animated Content from Static Graphics:** While TIFF is static, converting to GIF allows you to animate sequences of images, making it useful for creating short tutorials, demonstrations, or looping visual content.\n\n**\\- Reducing File Size for Web Use:** TIFF files are large, often uncompressed, and are not ideal for web use. Converting TIFF to GIF reduces file size and makes it easier to load on web pages or share via email and messaging.\n\n**\\- Ensuring Compatibility Across Platforms:** TIFF files are not supported by all browsers or devices, while GIFs are universally compatible, ensuring your images display correctly on any platform.\n\n**\\- Simplifying Graphics with Limited Colors:** For images or designs that don’t require extensive colors or detail, GIF provides a lightweight, optimized format that retains simplicity without the large file size of TIFF.\n\n## When to Use GIF Over TIFF\n\nGIF is a versatile format but is particularly well-suited to specific scenarios where simplicity, animation, and share ability are key:\n\n**\\- Web-Based Animations and Short Loops:** GIF is the standard for short, looping animations, making it ideal for reaction images, memes, and simple tutorials on social media and websites.\n\n**\\- Low-Color Web Graphics:** GIF’s limited color palette makes it ideal for graphics like icons, buttons, and logos that don’t require high color fidelity but need to load quickly on a web page.\n\n**\\- Email and Social Media Sharing:** GIFs are easily shareable on social media and in emails, where large file sizes could otherwise slow down loading times.\n\n**\\- Simple Overlays with Transparency:** GIF’s basic transparency allows for icons or logos that overlay well onto solid-colored backgrounds, though without the advanced transparency levels of formats like PNG.\n\n## Limitations of Converting TIFF to GIF\n\nWhile GIF offers several benefits, converting from TIFF to GIF involves a few trade-offs:\n\n**\\- Loss of Image Quality and Detail:** GIF’s limited color palette and compression result in lower quality than TIFF, making it unsuitable for detailed images or those with complex colors and gradients.\n\n**\\- Loss of Layers and Editing Capabilities:** TIFF files can contain multiple layers and pages, while GIFs are limited to a single layer. Converting to GIF will flatten any layers, which limits future editing.\n\n**\\- Reduced Color Depth:** GIF supports a maximum of 256 colors, which can result in color banding or loss of detail in images that require smooth gradients or high color accuracy.\n\n## Tips for Converting TIFF to GIF\n\nIf you’re ready to convert TIFF files to GIF, here are some tips to ensure the best possible results:\n\n**\\- Optimize Colors for GIF’s Limitations:** Since GIFs have a limited color palette, simplify the colors in your TIFF image before conversion if possible. Reducing colors can help keep file sizes down and improve visual clarity.\n\n**\\- Set Appropriate Frame Rate for Animations:** If you’re creating an animated GIF from a sequence of TIFF images, adjust the frame rate to ensure smooth playback without inflating file size.\n\n**\\- Choose Background Colors or Transparency:** Since GIFs support basic transparency, decide if your image needs a transparent background or a specific color before converting.\n\n**\\- Save Originals for Future Edits:** Once converted to GIF, images are difficult to edit. Keep the original TIFF files in case you need to return them for future changes.\n\n## Common Use Cases for GIF\n\nGIFs are effective in scenarios where file efficiency, animation, and compatibility are important. Here are a few practical applications:\n\n**\\- Reaction Images and Social Media Memes:** GIFs are the go-to format for quick, engaging animations on social media, allowing for seamless sharing and compatibility.\n\n**\\- Animated Icons and Web Graphics:** GIF is a practical choice for small animated icons, logos, and buttons that add interactivity without large file sizes.\n\n**\\- Simple Tutorials and Demonstrations:** GIFs are often used for step-by-step guides or simple demos, showing users how to complete tasks in a looping, easy-to-follow format.\n\n**\\- Email Marketing Visuals:** GIFs add movement to emails, helping content stand out while maintaining compatibility across all major email clients.\n\n## Conclusion: When to Convert TIFF to GIF\n\nConverting [TIFF to GIF](https://cloudinary.com/tools/tiff-to-gif) is a smart choice when animation, compatibility, and small file sizes are more important than high resolution and color fidelity. GIF is ideal for creating simple, engaging visuals that can be easily shared across platforms, from social media to email.\n\nIn summary, while TIFF is invaluable for high-resolution photography and archival images, GIF provides a lightweight, animated alternative for web content. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each format, you can choose the one that best fits your project needs, ensuring both quality and accessibility across digital platforms.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

This article will dive into the advantages and disadvantages of using passkeys, the concept of Conditional UI for autofill, the considerations of making passwords optional, and using passkeys for multi-factor authentication (MFA).\n\n[![Hanco](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgv7kd8y2eel5pjvd15uo.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fgv7kd8y2eel5pjvd15uo.png)\n\n🏆 : **Advantages and Disadvantages of a Passkey-Only Login**\n\nPasskeys leverage Web AUTH standards to authenticate users securely, eliminating the need for passwords. Instead, users can authenticate using biometrics (e.g., fingerprints or face recognition) or device-bound security keys.\n\n**Advantages of Passkeys**\n\n**1 Enhanced Security**: Passkeys are unique to each device and user, making them inherently more secure than passwords. Because they’re non-transferable, they minimize the risk of phishing and credential theft.\n\n**2 Improved User Experience**: With passkeys, users don’t have to remember complex passwords. A simple biometric scan or device-based verification is all that’s required.\n\n**3 Reduced IT Burden**: By removing passwords, support requests for forgotten passwords drop, saving time and resources.\n\n**Disadvantages of Passkeys**\n\n**1 Device Dependency**: Since passkeys are often stored locally, losing access to the original device may make it challenging for users to log in from a new device without a recovery mechanism.\n\n**2 Compatibility Limitations**: Some users may still have devices that aren’t compatible with WebAuth, limiting their ability to use passkey-only authentication.\n\n_Hanko provides solutions to these challenges, enabling fallback authentication methods and ensuring compatibility with WebAuth standards to make passkeys as accessible and effective as possible._\n\n🏆 : **Passkey Autofill with Conditional UI: Streamlining Authentication**\n\nConditional UI is a feature that enables passkey autofill prompts, appearing only when the context calls for them. This feature offers users a smoother login experience by showing the passkey prompt only when necessary.\n\n**_How Conditional UI Works in Passkey Autofill_**\n\nConditional UI leverages context to trigger autofill only when users have a passkey available, eliminating unnecessary distractions and reducing login friction. Here’s how you can implement it in a Hanko-based application:\n\n**1: [Set Up Hanko for Conditional UI](https://docs.hanko.io/introduction)** : Start by configuring Hanko to enable Conditional UI for your login flow.\n\n**2: Implement Conditional Autofill Prompt**:\n\n```\nimport Hanko from '@hanko/hanko-js';\n\nconst hanko = new Hanko('\u003cYOUR_HANKO_API_URL\u003e');\n\nasync function authenticateWithConditionalUI() {\n    try {\n        const user = await hanko.auth.webauthn.signIn({ conditionalUI: true });\n        console.log(\"Authenticated user:\", user);\n        // Handle successful login (e.g., redirect to a dashboard)\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error(\"Error during authentication:\", error);\n        // Handle error (e.g., show error message to user)\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**3: Test Autofill Flow**: Ensure the UI only prompts users with passkeys when the login form is active, enhancing the login experience and reducing unnecessary steps.\n\nConditional UI makes passkey-based logins feel more intuitive and seamless, aligning with Hanko’s vision for low-friction, user-friendly authentication.\n\n🏆 : **Making Passwords Optional: Key Considerations**\n\nMoving to password-optional authentication can simplify the login process and enhance security by reducing dependence on passwords. However, this approach requires certain considerations:\n\n**Why Make Passwords Optional?**\n\n**Increased Security**: Users are less likely to rely on weak or reused passwords.\n\n**Flexibility for Users**: Offering a choice between passkey-only and traditional passwords enables a smoother transition to passwordless authentication.\n\n👉 **Important Considerations**\n\n_Fallback and Recovery:_ Users may lose access to their passkey-enabled devices, so a fallback method, such as email verification, is essential.\n\n_Clear Communication_: Educate users about the option to delete passwords and the benefits of passkey authentication.\n\n_User Control_: Letting users delete passwords gives them control over their login experience while enhancing security.\n\n_Configuring Hanko for Password-Optional Logins:_ To make passwords optional with Hanko, configure your app to allow users to delete their passwords while retaining passkey-based authentication.\n\nvisit [docs](https://docs.hanko.io/setup-hanko-cloud) for setup:\n\n🏆: **Passkeys as a Password Replacement vs. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n\nPasskeys can function as both a password replacement or an additional layer in MFA. Understanding the difference between these use cases can help determine which approach is best suited for different security needs.\n\n**Using Passkeys as a Password Replacement**\n\n**Simplified Login**: Passkeys replace the need for passwords entirely, offering a faster, easier login experience.\n\n**Single-Factor Security**: Passkeys alone may be sufficient for most applications, especially when paired with biometrics.\n\nUsing Passkeys for MFA\n\n**Enhanced Security**: Adding passkeys as a second factor (in addition to a password) offers an extra layer of security, which is ideal for sensitive applications.\n\n**Reduced Phishing Risks**: Since users authenticate with something they have (the device) and something they are (biometric), MFA with passkeys becomes highly secure.\n\n**Configuring Hanko for MFA with Passkeys**: With Hanko, you can configure passkeys to act as either the primary or secondary authentication factor. Here’s an example setup for MFA:\n\n```\nasync function authenticateWithMFA() {\n   try {\n       const user = await hanko.auth.webauthn.signInWithMFA();\n       console.log(\"User authenticated with MFA:\", user);\n       // Redirect or handle login success\n   } catch (error) {\n       console.error(\"Error in MFA authentication:\", error);\n       // Handle error (e.g., show error message to user)\n   }\n}\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThis setup ensures that only authorized users with access to both a password and a passkey can log in, providing an additional layer of security for applications with high-security requirements.\n\n**Conclusion: _The Hanko Advantage_**\n\n[Hanko](https://www.hanko.io/) empowers developers to explore modern authentication strategies—passkey-only logins, Conditional UI, password-optional setups, and MFA with passkeys—using a versatile, open-source platform. By leveraging Hanko’s intuitive SDK and flexible configurations, you can design authentication flows that prioritize security, convenience, and user experience.\n\nAs the industry moves toward a passwordless future, Hanko’s support for passkeys and other cutting-edge security features positions it as a powerful ally in creating safe, user-friendly applications. Embrace the future of authentication with Hanko, and start building secure, password-free experiences today!\n\nThank you for reading 🙏\n\nbest regards\n\nAdil Kadivala ( [k-adi](https://www.github.com/adilkadivala))\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

In this case I made a video in two languages, and now I'm here for you, who prefer reading. As the title suggests, I want to clear up a misunderstanding, and in the meantime explain how many kind of Docker exists and what components Docker has. We will also cover some of the history of Docker.\n\nI often see that people think they are running \"dockers\". Keep in mind that \"Dockers\" is a garment company and has absolutely nothing to do with \"Docker\", the software.\n\nIf you prefer watching videos, most but not all of what I explain here can be watched on Youtube\n\nFor more videos, you can subscribe to my YouTube channel: [@akos.takacs](https://www.youtube.com/@akos.takacs)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [What I call Docker](#what-i-call-docker)\n- [Docker as a company](#docker-as-a-company)\n- [Docker as a software](#docker-as-a-software)  - [The beginning of Docker as a software and where we are now](#the-beginning-of-docker-as-a-software-and-where-we-are-now)\n  - [Two main ways of running the Docker daemon in terms of isolation](#two-main-ways-of-running-the-docker-daemon-in-terms-of-isolation)\n  - [Docker running in a virtual machine](#docker-running-in-a-virtual-machine)    - [Docker in a VM in general](#docker-in-a-vm-in-general)\n    - [Docker in a VM using Docker Desktop](#docker-in-a-vm-using-docker-desktop)\n  - [Docker runing directly on a physical machine](#docker-running-directly-on-a-physical-machine)    - [The source code of Moby](#the-source-code-of-moby)\n    - [Docker Enterprise Edition](#docker-enterprise-edition)\n    - [Docker IO](#docker-io)\n    - [Snap package](#snap-package)\n    - [Docker CE](#docker-ce)\n  - [Docker in Docker](#docker-in-docker)\n  - [Docker CE components](#docker-ce-components)    - [Two main parts of Docker CE](#two-main-parts-of-docker-ce)\n    - [Docker client](#docker-client)      - [The docker command](#the-docker-command)\n      - [Docker SDK](#docker-sdk)\n      - [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)\n    - [Docker daemon](#docker-daemon)      - [The history of dockerd](#the-history-of-dockerd)\n      - [Rootless vs Rootful Docker](#rootless-vs-rootful-docker)\n      - [Docker daemon dependencies](#docker-daemon-dependencies)\n  - [Podman pretending to be Docker](#podman-pretending-to-be-docker)\n  - [Packages and versioning](#packages-and-versioning)\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## What I call Docker\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nIn short, the Docker daemon. I could stop this post hear, since when I say \"I run Docker on a server\" I mean I run the Docker daemon, even if I don't have the client on that server. The daemon is required for running containers, but a container is not a docker, Docker just creates a container. Similarly to how bread is not a baker.\n\nUnfortunately, it is more complicated, so let's not stop this post here just yet.\n\n## Docker as a company\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThe company who made Docker as a software was \"dotCloud, Inc\". The website doesn't exist anymore, but you can still find the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/dotcloud). Later the company was renamed to \"Docker, Inc\" which was big news back then, and you can find some articles linked on [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/press-release/dotcloud-inc-now-docker-inc/).\n\n- Gigaom: The link takes you to an error page, so I don't even quote it.\n- InfoQ: [https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/10/dotcloud-renamed-docker/](https://www.infoq.com/news/2013/10/dotcloud-renamed-docker/)\n- Forbes: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/10/29/docker-and-the-timely-pivot/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2013/10/29/docker-and-the-timely-pivot/)\n\nNow, in a conversation we just say \"Docker\". For example \"Docker Desktop is Docker's product.\" or \"I know someone working at Docker\". In the rest of this blog post we will talk about Docker as a software.\n\n## Docker as a software\n\n### The beginning of Docker as a software and where we are now\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThe first commit of Docker happened on January 19, 2013. You can still find it on GitHub: [https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d](https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/a27b4b8cb8e838d03a99b6d2b30f76bdaf2f9e5d)\n\nNowadays, Docker has different variants and multiple components. So when we say Docker, we could mean the entire software family. Collection of different products. That is what makes the confusion.\n\n### Two main ways of running the Docker daemon in terms of isolation\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nYou can run Docker (meaning the Docker daemon) directly on a server or even on your machine, but there are two kind of containers. Linux containers require a Linux host. Windows containers require a Windows host. This is because a container is not a virtual machine. A container is just a process running on your host in an isolated way, so the process can't see everything on the host, only what it is allowed to see.\n\nThis means if you have a Windows machine, and you want to try Linux containers, you are in trouble. No... I'm kidding. But it is true that in this case you could not run Linux containers without the help of virtual machines.\n\nI haven't mentioned macOS yet, because there is no such thing as \"macOS container\" at the moment, but you can install Docker in a virtual machine even on macOS.\n\n### Docker running in a virtual machine\n\n#### Docker in a VM in general\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nIf you want to run Linux containers on Windows or macOS, you need a virtual machine with a Linux operating system inside. If you want to run Windows containers on Linux or macOS, you could probably try a Windows VM, but I have never tried and Windows containers are different so you would also need to deal with [two different isolation modes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container) and the HyperV isolation mode would require nested virtualization enabled for your virtual machine.\n\n#### Docker in a VM using Docker Desktop\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nA special way of using Docker in a virtual machine is when you have the client on your host and the Docker daemon is in the virtual machine. You could configure it manually similarly to how you would [configure a remote Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/remote-access/) for your local client, but Docker Desktop solves it for you.\n\nDocker Desktop can run on Windows, macOS and also on Linux. Yes, it runs on Linux, but it still creates a virtual machine instead of accessing the Docker daemon on your host.\n\nWhen you run Docker Desktop on Windows, you can also switch between Windows containers and Linux containers, but Windows containers are supported by Docker Desktop only on Windows. You could try running [Docker Desktop in a Windows VM](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/vm-vdi/), but that would also require nested virtualization if you want to use Docker Desktop for running Linux containers, or Windows containers with HyperV isolation. Not to mention that as far as I remember, you could not even install Docker Desktop if you don't have HyperV or WSL2 enabled, which requires nested virtualization in a VM.\n\n#### Docker is actually Docker Desktop on macOS\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nOne problem on macOS that adds more confusion is that the application which you can install on macOS is called \"Docker\". When you open the launchpad, the label below the Docker icon is \"Docker\". Don't forget that you are still using Docker Desktop and the Docker daemon is running inside the virtual machine as well as all your containers.\n\n### Docker running directly on a physical machine\n\n#### The source code of Moby\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nI shared the first commit of Docker's source code at the beginning of the \"Docker as a software\" section. The source code is on GitHub in the [moby/moby](https://github.com/moby/moby) repository. During the years since Docker was created, many repositories were used. \"moby/moby\" was originally called \"dotcloud/docker\" and the URL still works ( [http://github.com/dotcloud/docker](http://github.com/dotcloud/docker)). When the company was renamed, the repository was renamed again to \"docker/docker\" ( [https://github.com/dotcloud/docker](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker)), but both are redirected to Moby today. Moby is the base source code of the Docker variants we have today.\n\n#### Docker Enterprise Edition\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nYears ago there was a Docker EE (Enterprise Edition), but it was bought by [Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/), who made the [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://www.mirantis.com/software/mirantis-container-runtime/). You can even read it on their website:\n\n\u003e Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly Docker Engine - Enterprise)\n\nSince I'm focusing on Docker, this is all I wanted to say about an edition that does not exist today.\n\n#### Docker IO\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\n`docker.io` is based on Moby, but not supported by Docker, Inc. You could find this package on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux distribution. On Ubuntu, running `apt info docker.io` reveals that it is maintained by \"Ubuntu Developers\". The output of the command contains exactly\n\n```\nMaintainer: Ubuntu Developers \u003cubuntu-devel-discuss@lists.ubuntu.com\u003e\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nand the following on Debian\n\n```\nMaintainer: Debian Go Packaging Team \u003cteam+pkg-go@tracker.debian.org\u003e\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThe [Internet Archive's \"Wayback machine\" reveals](https://web.archive.org/web/20140718091133/http://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) that the earlier installation guide for Ubuntu started with installing `docker.io`, but recent guides start with removing `docker.io`.\n\nI don't recommend using `docker.io` today as it will install an older version (at the time of writing this post, it is 24.0.7 on Ubuntu 22.04) and most of the tutorials will show you features based the official version and the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).\n\n#### Snap package\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThere is a [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/docker) which is also based on Moby, but built by Canonical. I quote:\n\n\u003e Authors\n\u003e\n\u003e This snap is built by Canonical based on source code published by Docker, Inc. It is not endorsed or published by Docker, Inc.\n\nSo I don't recommend this variant either, unless the installation guide of the official version doesn't work on your distribution but Snap does. A snap is basically a kind of container with possible restrictions like you can only mount files from your home directory.\n\n#### Docker CE\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nDocker CE is the Docker Community Edition based on Moby and [officially supported by Docker, Inc]([official%20documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)). So when you want to install Docker on Linux without a virtual machine, this is what I recommend. This is also what you can install on a Windows server, but the installation is [described by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=dockerce#windows-server-1).\n\n## Docker in Docker\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThe term \"Docker in Docker\" is misleading. You are not running Docker in a Docker. As I explained, the word Docker should be used for the Docker daemon, but you are not running a Docker daemon in a Docker daemon.\n\nThen what is that you are doing when using Docker in Docker? You are running a Docker daemon inside a Docker container. Since calling it \"Docker daemon in Docker container\" would be long and wouldn't sound as good, we call it \"Docker in Docker\" in short.\n\nIf you want to try it, you can find [Docker images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) and you can use a Docker image downloaded (pulled) from Docker Hub to run a Docker container in which you run a Docker daemon to run isolated processes (containers) in an already isolated environment.\n\n## Docker CE components\n\n### Two main parts of Docker CE\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, you can run a Docker daemon in a virtual machine or on a remote machine and still keep the \"docker\" command on your local machine. This is possible because we can talk about two main parts of Docker CE. The client and the daemon. The client can be anywhere, but the daemon has to be where the containers will be running.\n\nThe client can instruct the Docker daemon through a TCP or Unix socket [using the API service](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/), but a \"client\" can mean multiple things.\n\n### Docker Client\n\n#### The docker command\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nOften when we talk about the Docker client, we think of the \"docker\" command used in a terminal. For a beginner, who sees the name of the command, it could be confusing, but this is not the entire Docker, and it will not run \"dockers\", but Docker containers.\n\n#### Docker SDK\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThe client [can also be SDK](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/sdk/), although the SDKs are for the core Docker and not for the plugins like [Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx).\n\n#### Docker Compose\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThere is another plugin called [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). There was a Compose v1 originally written in Python for which we used the `docker-compose` command, but now we need to use `docker compose` without the dash.\n\nBoth versions require a so-called \"compose file\", but v1 required `docker-compose.yml` while the new version accept `compose.yml` as well. The other difference is that v1 required\n\n```\nversion: XY\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nat the beginning of the file to specify which version of the compose syntax we wanted to use and the XY was a number like 3.8. So this was never the version of Docker Compose, but the version of the compose schema in the yaml file. For more information about the history of Docker Compose, you can visit the [description in the official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/history/).\n\n### Docker Daemon\n\n#### The history of dockerd\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nThe Docker daemon can be started by running `dockerd`. Until [Docker 1.8.0](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/prior-releases/#180-2015-08-11), the daemon could be started with the docker command using the `-d` flag, but it was changed to `docker daemon` replacing the flag with a subcommand. Then [that became deprecated too](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/prior-releases/#deprecation) in Docker 1.13 after the dockerd binary was introduced in [Docker 1.12](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/prior-releases/#1120-2016-07-28).\n\n#### Rootless vs rootful Docker\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nOriginally the Docker daemon required a root user. Running it as a non-root user [became possible in Docker CE 19.03](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/19.03/#runtime-11) as an experimental feature which was already one of the core features of Podman (we will talk about it later) from the beginning. This is what we call \"rootless mode\", so the original mode became the \"rootful mode\".\n\n#### Docker daemon dependencies\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nOriginally, Docker was a single binary. Before introducing the \"dockerd\" command for the daemon, `docker-containerd`, `docker-containerd-shim` and `docker-runc` was introduced in [Docker 1.11](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/prior-releases/#1110-2016-04-13).\n\nSo once we had a single binary, then \"Docker, Inc\" started separating the functionalities into multiple binaries on Linux. That was the beginning the of dependencies and components we have today, except that these dependencies are now not limited to Docker. [containerd](https://containerd.io/) can also be the [container runtime of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#containerd).\n\nAs the \"docker\" command is the client for \"dockerd\", [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) is the client for containerd, although the project was started only [at the end of 2020](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/commit/f0d302cac40fbdbfcfe74a3ba5cbefdf2f5b3741).\n\nNow we have dockerd which uses containerd, but containerd will not create containers directly. It needs a runtime and the [default runtime is runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc), but that can be changed. containerd actually doesn't have to know the parameters of the runtime. There is a shim process between containerd and runc, so containerd knows the parameters of the shim, and the shim knows the parameters of runc or other runtimes.\n\n## Podman pretending to be Docker\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nI admit the title of this section sounds worse than it is, but the fact is that sometimes when you install [Podman](https://podman.io/), you can also have an alias called \"docker\" pointing to \"podman\". That can make you believe that you are running Docker and come to the Docker forum asking about an issue which is actually not related to Docker. The alias exists because Podman tries to keep a similar command line interface to the interface of Docker, so when someone relies on an existing docker command, they don't have to rewrite their scripts if they are lucky.\n\nBut again, Podman is not Docker and Podman Desktop is not Docker Desktop!\n\nThe `docker version` and `docker info` commands can give you an idea of what you are actually using.\n\n## Packages and versioning\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nIn my mind the core components of Docker CE are the Docker daemon and the Docker client. When you install Docker CE on Linux, after you added the official APT repository provided by \"Docker, Inc\", the following packages could be installed:\n\n- **docker-ce**: The daemon\n- **docker-ce-rootless-extras**: Scripts to run rootless Docker\n- **docker-ce-cli**: The docker command\n\nThese packages have the same version. You can use a different version of the command line interface (cli), but if you want to make sure that the docker command is compatible with the API of the Docker daemon, use the same versions.\n\nEverything else listed below has completely independent version numbers:\n\n- docker-compose (Compose v1)\n- Plugins\n\n  - docker-compose-plugin (Compose v2)\n  - docker-buildx\n  - docker-init (only in Docker Desktop)\n- Docker Desktop\n- Docker daemon dependencies\n\n  - containerd\n  - containerd-shim\\*\n  - runc\n\n## Conclusion\n\n[» Back to table of contents «](#table-of-contents)\n\nDocker has a long history, and it changed a lot during the years, but one thing was always true. You always ran containers and not dockers. If you say \"I want to run multiple dockers\" on the Docker forum, we will think that you want to run multiple Docker daemons. Well... since we are kind of trained by our users, we will eventually realize what you mean, but knowing the right terms helps you communicate your issue better and get an answer faster.\n\nBefore you ask a question, always think about what you are using and communicate that to the potential helpers.\n\nAnd finally, you can find an important screenshot from the video below that shows all the variants and components I described in this post.

Hardcoding secrets in your source code or keeping them in plain text files is a risky approach. This is where HashiCorp Vault comes into play. Vault is an open-source tool for managing secrets, such as credentials, API keys, and sensitive configurations.\n\nIn this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of:\n\nInstalling HashiCorp Vault on Windows\n\nIntegrating it with a Node.js application\n\nPerforming basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with email-password pairs stored in Vault.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore we dive in, make sure you have the following:\n\nNode.js installed on your system.\n\nA basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.\n\nHashiCorp Vault installed.\n\n* * *\n\nStep 1: Installing HashiCorp Vault on Windows\n\nLet's start by setting up Vault on your local machine.\n\nDownload Vault\n\nGo to the official Vault downloads page and download the Windows binary.\n\nUnzip the downloaded file and move the vault.exe file to a directory (e.g., C:\\\\vault).\n\nAdd Vault to PATH\n\nOpen the Start Menu and search for Environment Variables.\n\nIn System Variables, find Path and click Edit.\n\nAdd the directory where vault.exe is located (C:\\\\vault) to the list.\n\nOpen a new Command Prompt and verify the installation by running:\n\nvault --version\n\nStart Vault in Development Mode\n\nStart the Vault server in development mode using this command:\n\nvault server -dev\n\nThis command will launch Vault locally, and you should see a Root Token displayed in the terminal. Save it for later; you'll need it to authenticate.\n\n* * *\n\nStep 2: Setting Up a Node.js Project\n\nNow that Vault is running, we will set up a Node.js project to interact with Vault.\n\nInitialize a New Node.js Project\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and navigate into it:\n\nmkdir vault-node-app cd vault-node-app\n\n1. Initialize a new Node.js project:\nnpm init -y\n2. Install the required dependencies:\nnpm install node-vault dotenv\nnode-vault: This is the official Node.js client for Vault.\ndotenv: To manage environment variables.\n\nStep 3: Integrating Vault with Node.js\n\nConfigure Environment Variables\n\nCreate a .env file in your project root directory to store Vault configurations:\n\n`VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200\nVAULT_TOKEN=\u003cyour-root-token\u003e`\n\nReplace with the root token displayed when you started Vault in development mode.\n\nCreate the Node.js Script\n\nCreate a new index.js file in your project directory and paste the following code:\n\n`require('dotenv').config();\nconst vault = require('node-vault')({\napiVersion: 'v1',\nendpoint: process.env.VAULT_ADDR,\ntoken: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN\n});\nconst SECRET_PATH = 'secret/data/users'; // Path to store user secrets\n// Save email and password\nasync function saveCredentials(email, password) {\ntry {\n    const result = await vault.write(SECRET_PATH, {\n      data: {\n        [email]: { password }\n      }\n    });\n    console.log(` Credentials saved for ${email}: `, result);\n} catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error saving credentials:', error);\n}\n}\n// Update credentials by email\nasync function updateCredentials(email, newPassword) {\ntry {\n    const result = await vault.write(SECRET_PATH, {\n      data: {\n        [email]: { password: newPassword }\n      }\n    });\n    console.log(` Credentials updated for ${email}: `, result);\n} catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error updating credentials:', error);\n}\n}\n// Get credentials by email\nasync function getCredentials(email) {\ntry {\n    const result = await vault.read(SECRET_PATH);\n    const userData = result.data.data[email];\n    if (userData) {\n      console.log(` Retrieved credentials for ${email}: `, userData);\n    } else {\n      console.log(` No credentials found for ${email} `);\n    }\n} catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error retrieving credentials:', error);\n}\n}\n// Delete credentials by email\nasync function deleteCredentials(email) {\ntry {\n    const result = await vault.delete(SECRET_PATH);\n    console.log(` Credentials deleted for ${email} `);\n} catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error deleting credentials:', error);\n}\n}\n// Example Usage\n(async () =\u003e {\nawait saveCredentials('test@example.com', 'password123');\nawait getCredentials('test@example.com');\nawait updateCredentials('test@example.com', 'newpassword456');\nawait getCredentials('test@example.com');\nawait deleteCredentials('test@example.com');\n})();`\n\nExplanation of Code\n\nSave credentials: Stores an email and password in Vault.\n\nUpdate credentials: Updates the password for the provided email.\n\nRetrieve credentials: Fetches stored credentials using the email.\n\nDelete credentials: Deletes the credentials for the given email.\n\nWe are using the secret/data/users path in Vault to store and manage user data.\n\n* * *\n\nStep 4: Running the Application\n\nTo run the application, use the following command:\n\nnode index.js\n\nThe script will:\n\nSave the email and password to Vault.\n\nRetrieve the credentials using the email.\n\nUpdate the password.\n\nRetrieve the updated credentials.\n\nDelete the stored credentials.\n\n* * *\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy following this tutorial, you now have a fully functional Node.js application that integrates with HashiCorp Vault. This setup provides you with a secure and scalable way to manage sensitive information like email-password pairs in your application.\n\nHashiCorp Vault is a powerful tool for storing secrets, and its integration with Node.js is relatively straightforward using the node-vault library. You can expand this setup to store other secrets like API keys, tokens, and more.\n\nIf you're building any application that requires sensitive data management, it's highly recommended to adopt a secure storage mechanism like Vault to reduce security risks.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Bifold doors are operated by special metal rails that need regular maintenance. If you don't, your bifold door will begin to slide and scrape the floor.\n\nThese problems can be easily fixed by simple DIY fixes.\n\nDoors that aren't closing\n\nSagging doors can have a negative effect on the appearance and functionality of your home. bifold door repairs can cause gaps in doors, which can make closing and opening difficult, and can even lead to structural damage. There are several methods to restore the functionality and appearance of doors that have sagging. First, tighten any loose hinge screws. This usually is enough to solve the issue, but if not then you may try adding shims in order to correct the orientation of the door in the frame.\n\nNext, examine the door frame. If the hinges are rusty, they might not be able to support the weight of the door. It is possible to remove the hinges that have rust and replace them with new ones to restore their strength and ability to support the weight of your door. Use longer screws to provide a stronger anchor and prevent any future sagging.\n\nIf you're experiencing an unsteady door, it could be due to a variety of issues, such as a shifting foundation or changes in humidity. If the issue is minor or large, it's important to take action quickly. If not, it could get worse over time and lead to numerous issues such as drafts, energy loss, and even structural damage to the house.\n\nOne of the most frequent causes of sagging is an outdated or damaged set of hinges. The hinges that are older can't support the weight of a door, and they tend to wear out over time. This is especially true if the hinges have been exposed to elements such as rain or snow. Installing new hinges can solve this issue. They are durable and designed to last.\n\nAnother common cause of sagging is that the latch mechanism has fallen and is not aligned anymore with the strike plate. To fix this, you can either lower the strike plate, or add an shim to the door's bottom. If you decide to lower the strike plate, you'll have to shave off a part of the door jamb and risk mucking up the screw holes. If you install a shim, however you won't have to worry about damaging the jamb, or the strike plate.\n\nDoors that don't shut properly\n\nMany homes in the UK have bifold doors. They can be used both internally for partitioning, or externally to make a space more open and connect it to an outdoor living space or summer house. These doors can also be used to increase the security of homes. However, like any door they can become damaged in time. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including wear and tear or harsh weather conditions. In some instances the door could be misaligned or even break. Thankfully, this is usually an easy solve.\n\nCheck the track for obstructions and debris if the bifold door isn't closing properly. Sometimes, dust and dirt could get caught between the tracks, which can cause the door to not close or make a scrubbing noise when it's opened. It's recommended to oil the hinges and rollers to stop this from happening in the future.\n\nIf your bifold door emits a loud scraping sound when it is opened, it is probably something stuck in the tracks or mechanism. This is a common problem for bifold doors, and it can be fixed by removing the object. You can also lubricate your tracks to see if this can help.\n\nIt can also be caused by the latch or strike plate not aligned with latch holes in the door frame. This could be caused by a loose or worn hinge, a shift of the door frame or the threshold. It is possible to re-align the door by tightening the screws on the hinges or by using screws that are longer.\n\nLastly, it's worth remembering that pets, children and accidents all put a lot of pressure on your doors or cause them to move. This can cause the doors to break or become damaged, which can result in them not closing correctly. You could sand or hammer old screw holes that were made into the door frame, and then apply wood filler to match its color.\n\nDoors that become stuck\n\nIt is important to understand what's happening if your bifold doors are stuck. Generally, it's because the system isn't operating correctly. There are some things you can try before calling an expert, and you should always check that the door frame is fitted properly. This is especially crucial for commercial bifold doors because they must be able to operate reliably and easily.\n\nThe good news is that bifold doors are extremely versatile, and they can make a room appear more open and spacious. They can be utilized for any reason, whether you're looking to connect living spaces, create a dining area or make a kitchen appear larger. They are also used in commercial spaces, to make restaurants and retailers more appealing and inviting to patrons. They also increase the amount of light that can be absorbed into rooms.\n\nThey are attached by a top nut that connects to a bracket. These brackets have multiple settings which allows you to adjust their height and move the door up or down. They can also be adjusted by unwinding the screw and moving it to the left or right, however you should never force a door into position because this could damage the frame and cause the lock to break.\n\nDirt or debris can obstruct the track or runners. Grit is typically the cause and cleaning the tracks can easily fix this problem. Use a cleaner designed for household fixtures and fittings. Avoid using any product that is too powerful, as this could cause damage to the seals.\n\nThe lock on a bifold door may not work. This is a serious problem as it can leave your door unlocked and open to anyone who is able operate it. This could pose an enigma for security and it's crucial to address this as soon as possible.\n\nDoors that slide off the track\n\nBifold doors are a great way to connect indoor and outdoor spaces. They're incredibly adaptable, opening the space around them, and allowing for continuous flow of light and air. They're perfect for kitchens and living areas that open up onto the balcony or garden, as well as dressing rooms and walk-in closets.\n\nThey are typically made up of a set of panels that slide on runners that run across the floor as well as the upper lintel or beam of the doorway. They are available in a range of materials including aluminium, timber, upvc and. The glazed panels can be toughened or reinforced to provide greater security. This is essential for bifolding doors with external openings that are exposed to elements.\n\nNo matter if they're installed outside or inside Bifold doors require minimal maintenance once they're functional. Regularly cleaning the glass and frames will keep them looking fresh as new, and just a bit of gentle lubrication from time time can help them move smoothly and stop sagging or scraping the floor.\n\nHowever, there are some things that can affect your bifold doors and make them more prone to fall off the track than they are. The rollers that allow the doors to move smoothly upwards and downwards are the main culprit. The rollers can cause the door to go off track if they are not properly lubricated or they fail completely.\n\nThis could be risky when doors are closed and opened frequently, so it's worth making sure that the rollers are in good working order. Another problem that can be found is damaged hardware, especially the hinges and bottom rollers. They can freeze in place, or start to wobble and fall off completely.\n\nIt's also possible for locks to break, which can be a major issue when the door is used frequently and frequently. This can be caused by excess pressure or simply ageing. To stop this from happening it's recommended to get your locks serviced regularly. These services are quite affordable, and can help you avoid the expensive repairs that come with broken locks.\n\n[bifold door repairs](https://stairways.wiki/wiki/Do_Not_Buy_Into_These_Trends_About_Bifold_Door_Repair)\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

They allow for stable endpoints that remain constant, even if the underlying pods change.\n\n**Types of Kubernetes Services**\n\n- **ClusterIP**: The default service type, exposing the service within the Kubernetes cluster only. It's useful for internal communication between services or pods.\n- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port on each node’s IP, enabling access from outside the cluster via `\u003cNodeIP\u003e:\u003cNodePort\u003e`. Often used in development for simple external access but can have security risks in production.\n- **LoadBalancer**: Integrates with cloud providers to automatically create an external load balancer, which routes traffic to your services. This type is most common for exposing services to the internet in production environments on managed Kubernetes clusters.\n- **ExternalName**: Maps a service to an external DNS name by returning a CNAME record. Useful when pointing to external services outside of the Kubernetes environment, without complex configurations.\n\n* * *\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, ensure you have the following [configuration](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#creating-a-cluster) for your KIND cluster:\n\n```\nkind: Cluster\napiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4\nname: cka-cluster\nnodes:\n- role: control-plane\n  extraPortMappings:\n  - containerPort: 30001  # Change this to match the NodePort\n    hostPort: 30001\n    listenAddress: \"0.0.0.0\"\n    protocol: tcp\n- role: worker\n- role: worker\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThis YAML file sets up a Kubernetes cluster named `cka-cluster` with one control plane node and two worker nodes. The `extraPortMappings` section maps port 30001 to allow external access to the NodePort service.\n\n* * *\n\n### 1\\. Create a Service named `myapp` of type ClusterIP\n\n- **Goal:** This creates an internal network endpoint accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster, allowing internal traffic routing to your application.\n- **Details:** The `ClusterIP` type will not be accessible outside the cluster, so it’s used here to facilitate communication between Pods and other resources internally. The Service will map port 80 to the target port 80 on the Pods.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n**Create the KIND cluster** (if you haven’t already):\n\n```\n   kind create cluster --name kind-cka-cluster --config \u003ckind.yml\u003e\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Switch context to your new KIND cluster** (if required):\n\n```\n   kubectl config use-context kind-kind-cka-cluster\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Create the Service manifest**:\n\nOpen a new YAML file using your preferred editor:\n\n```\n   nano service.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Define the Service**:\n\nCopy the following YAML configuration into `service.yml`:\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: myapp\nspec:\n  type: ClusterIP\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp  # Change this to match your pod labels. I copied this of the k8s docs\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      protocol: TCP\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Apply the Service configuration**:\n\n```\n   kubectl apply -f service.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Verify the Service is running**:\n\n```\n   kubectl get services\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThis will create the `myapp` Service, of type `ClusterIP`, mapping port 80 on the Service to port 80 on the target Pods.\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Create a Deployment named `myapp`\n\n- **Goal:** The Deployment manages Pod replicas for nginx (in this case, version `1.23.4-alpine`), ensuring they’re running and available.\n\n- **Details:** By setting up a Deployment, you gain automatic scalability, rolling updates, and easier management. You expose the container’s port 80, which the Service will use to route traffic.\n\n\n#### Steps:\n\n**Create the Deployment manifest**:\n\nOpen a new YAML file using your preferred editor:\n\n```\nnano deployment.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Define the Deployment**:\n\nCopy the following YAML configuration into `deployment.yml`:\n\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: myapp\n  labels:\n    app: nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: MyApp\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: MyApp\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.23.4-alpine\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Apply the Deployment configuration**:\n\nRun the following command to create the Deployment:\n\n```\nkubectl apply -f deployment.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Verify the Deployment is running**:\n\nCheck the status by running:\n\n```\nkubectl get deployments\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Scale the Deployment to 2 replicas\n\n- **Goal:** This tests the load-balancing functionality of the Service, as it should distribute traffic across the two Pod instances.\n\n- **Details:** You can scale the Deployment either by updating the manifest to set `replicas: 2` or by using a `kubectl` command.\n\n\n#### Steps:\n\nUpdate the Deployment manifest: If you want to change the number of replicas in the YAML, edit the `replicas` field:\n\n```\nreplicas: 2  # Update to 2 for scaling\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nAlternatively, use `kubectl` to scale the Deployment: Run the following command to scale the Deployment:\n\n```\nkubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=2\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nVerify the scaling: Run the following command to check that the new Pods are created and ready:\n\n```\nkubectl get pods\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Create a Temporary Pod Using busybox and Run `wget` Against the Service IP\n\n- **Goal:** This verifies that the Service is reachable from within the cluster.\n\n- **Details:** You’ll launch a temporary `busybox` Pod and run `wget` to check if it can access the `myapp` Service over its ClusterIP. This step assumes you’re comfortable finding the Service’s ClusterIP (accessible via `kubectl get svc`).\n\n\n**Important Labeling Warning:** Ensure that the labels in the Service selector match the Deployment's matchLabels exactly. Misalignment will prevent the Service from routing traffic to the correct Pods.\n\n#### Steps:\n\n**Find the Service IP:**\n\nRun the following command to retrieve the ClusterIP of `myapp`:\n\n```\n   kubectl get services\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\n   NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\n   myapp      ClusterIP   10.96.87.231   \u003cnone\u003e        80/TCP    10h\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Create the Temporary Pod:**\n\nUse the following command to create a `busybox` Pod and run `wget` to test connectivity:\n\n```\n   kubectl run busybox --image=busybox -it --rm --restart=Never -- wget myapp:80\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Command Breakdown:**\n\n- **--image=busybox:** Specifies `busybox` as the image to pull.\n- **-it:** Interactive terminal, which allows you to access the command line inside the Pod.\n- **--rm:** Cleans up and removes the Pod after the command completes.\n- **--restart=Never:** Ensures Kubernetes does not attempt to restart the Pod after it finishes.\n- **wget myapp:80:** Sends a request to the `myapp` Service at port 80, confirming connectivity.\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\nYou should see output similar to the following upon a successful connection:\n\n```\n   Connecting to myapp:80 (10.96.87.231:80)\n   saving to 'index.html'\n   index.html           100% |********************************|   615  0:00:00 ETA\n   'index.html' saved\n   pod \"busybox\" deleted\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThis output confirms that the Service is accessible within the cluster and can successfully handle requests from other Pods.\n\n* * *\n\n### 5\\. **Run a `wget` Command Against the Service from Outside the Cluster**\n\n- **Goal:** This tests if external traffic can reach the Service (spoiler: it won’t, as it’s still a `ClusterIP` type).\n- **Steps:** From an external machine or terminal, try reaching the Service IP. You won’t get a response because `ClusterIP` restricts access to within the cluster.\n\n**Find the Service IP:**\n\nRun the following command to retrieve the ClusterIP of `myapp`:\n\n```\nkubectl get services\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Example output:**\n\n```\nNAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\nmyapp      ClusterIP   10.96.87.231   \u003cnone\u003e        80/TCP    10h\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nNext, attempt to use `wget` to access the Service:\n\n```\nwget myapp:80\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n--2024-10-27 06:49:46--  http://myapp/\nResolving myapp (myapp)... failed: nodename nor servname provided, or not known.\nwget: unable to resolve host address ‘myapp’\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n* * *\n\n### 6\\. **Change the Service Type for External Access**\n\n- **Goal:** Now, we want to change the Service type so it’s accessible externally.\n- **Details:** Changing the Service type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` enables external traffic. Use `NodePort` if you want to access it through a specific node’s IP and port, or `LoadBalancer` if your cloud provider’s load balancer will handle it.\n\n**Rationale:** Instead of executing commands directly in the terminal, we should leverage YAML files for defining our configurations. This approach not only facilitates source control but also ensures that our infrastructure as code (IaC) practices are consistent and reproducible.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n**Remove the existing service configuration:**\n\n```\n   rm service.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Create a new service definition using your preferred text editor:**\n\n```\n   nano service.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Copy the following YAML configuration (adapted from the Kubernetes documentation) into `service.yml`:**\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: myapp\nspec:\n  type: NodePort\n  selector:\n    app: MyApp\n  ports:\n    - port: 80\n      targetPort: 80\n      nodePort: 30001  # Optional: Define the node port if desired\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Deploy the new service configuration:**\n\n```\n   kubectl apply -f service.yml\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport).\n\n* * *\n\n### 7\\. **Access the Service in Your Browser or Using `curl`**\n\n- **Goal:** This confirms external access to the Service once exposed.\n- **Details:** You can visit the nginx homepage in your browser or use `curl` to see the response from the service.\n- **Command:**\n\n\n\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:30001\n\n```\n\n\n### Discussion Points\n\n1. **Exposing Pods without a Deployment:**\n   - **Can it be done?** Yes, it’s possible to create a Service that directly exposes individual Pods by using `spec.selector` to match the Pods' labels.\n   - **Why (or why not)?** However, Deployments provide benefits like auto-scaling, rolling updates, and ensuring a specified number of Pods are always running, which wouldn’t be handled automatically if only using a Service.\n2. **Choosing Service Types:**\n   - **ClusterIP:** Use it for internal traffic only, where the Service should only be accessible within the cluster. Great for microservices that need to communicate with each other.\n   - **NodePort:** This makes the Service accessible on each Node's IP at a specific port, allowing limited external access. Often used for development or testing but not ideal for production as it doesn’t offer load balancing.\n   - **LoadBalancer:** Ideal for production in cloud environments, as it distributes incoming traffic across multiple nodes or Pods and abstracts the complexity of handling traffic.\n   - **ExternalName:** This type creates an alias for an external hostname, allowing Pods to access external services using Kubernetes DNS. Suitable for situations where in-cluster services need access to an external service, but it’s limited to simple DNS resolution.\n\n* * *\n\n### Tags and Mentions\n\n[@piyushsachdeva](https://dev.to/piyushsachdeva)\n\nDay 8 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHAQWLKMTB0\u0026list=PLl4APkPHzsUUOkOv3i62UidrLmSB8DcGC\u0026index=11\u0026ab_channel=TechTutorialswithPiyush)\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

In this post, we’ll create a **scheduling system in Next.js** that includes **real-time availability**, **reminder emails**, and an **easy-to-use calendar**. Perfect for booking appointments, consultations, or even team meetings!\n\n### 🛠️ Project Setup\n\nTo build our scheduling system, we'll use:\n\n1. **Next.js** for the frontend and server-side APIs.\n2. **MySQL** to store appointments and time slots.\n3. **Nodemailer** for email reminders.\n4. **React-Calendar** for date selection.\n\n### 🚀 Getting Started\n\nInitialize your Next.js project:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app scheduling-system\ncd scheduling-system\nnpm install mysql react-calendar nodemailer\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n### 📅 Setting Up the Database\n\nFirst, set up your **MySQL** database. We’ll create tables for **appointments** and **time slots**.\n\n#### 1\\. Create Database Tables\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE time_slots (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  slot_time TIME NOT NULL,\n  is_available BOOLEAN DEFAULT true\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE appointments (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n  slot_id INT,\n  customer_name VARCHAR(255),\n  customer_email VARCHAR(255),\n  appointment_date DATE,\n  FOREIGN KEY (slot_id) REFERENCES time_slots(id)\n);\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n### 🧑‍💻 Building the Next.js API\n\nNow, let’s create API routes in `pages/api` for managing **appointments** and **availability**.\n\n#### 1\\. Get Available Slots\n\nIn `pages/api/slots.js`:\n\n```\nimport db from '../../db';\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  db.query('SELECT * FROM time_slots WHERE is_available = true', (err, results) =\u003e {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    res.status(200).json(results);\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n#### 2\\. Book an Appointment\n\nIn `pages/api/book.js`:\n\n```\nimport db from '../../db';\n\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { customerName, customerEmail, slotId, appointmentDate } = req.body;\n\n  // Mark the slot as booked\n  db.query('UPDATE time_slots SET is_available = false WHERE id = ?', [slotId], (err) =\u003e {\n    if (err) throw err;\n\n    // Create an appointment record\n    db.query(\n      'INSERT INTO appointments (slot_id, customer_name, customer_email, appointment_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',\n      [slotId, customerName, customerEmail, appointmentDate],\n      (err) =\u003e {\n        if (err) throw err;\n        res.status(201).json({ message: 'Appointment booked!' });\n      }\n    );\n  });\n}\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n### 📆 Creating the Scheduling UI\n\nUsing **react-calendar**, let’s create a **calendar interface** where users can view available slots and book appointments.\n\n#### 1\\. Install `react-calendar`\n\n```\nnpm install react-calendar\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n#### 2\\. Schedule Component with Calendar\n\nCreate a component in `components/Schedule.js`:\n\n```\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport Calendar from 'react-calendar';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nexport default function Schedule() {\n  const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());\n  const [slots, setSlots] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    async function fetchSlots() {\n      const { data } = await axios.get('/api/slots');\n      setSlots(data);\n    }\n    fetchSlots();\n  }, []);\n\n  const handleBooking = async (slotId) =\u003e {\n    await axios.post('/api/book', {\n      customerName: 'Jane Doe',\n      customerEmail: 'jane.doe@example.com',\n      slotId,\n      appointmentDate: date\n    });\n    alert('Appointment Booked!');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv\u003e\n      \u003cCalendar onChange={setDate} value={date} /\u003e\n      \u003ch3\u003eAvailable Slots on {date.toDateString()}:\u003c/h3\u003e\n      \u003cul\u003e\n        {slots.map(slot =\u003e (\n          \u003cli key={slot.id}\u003e\n            {slot.slot_time}\n            \u003cbutton onClick={() =\u003e handleBooking(slot.id)}\u003eBook\u003c/button\u003e\n          \u003c/li\u003e\n        ))}\n      \u003c/ul\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n### 📧 Setting Up Automated Email Reminders\n\nInstall **Nodemailer** for sending email reminders:\n\n```\nnpm install nodemailer\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nIn `utils/sendReminderEmail.js`, define an email reminder function:\n\n```\nimport nodemailer from 'nodemailer';\n\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({\n  service: 'gmail',\n  auth: {\n    user: 'your_email@gmail.com',\n    pass: 'your_password',\n  },\n});\n\nexport const sendReminderEmail = async (email, appointmentDate) =\u003e {\n  const mailOptions = {\n    from: 'your_email@gmail.com',\n    to: email,\n    subject: 'Appointment Reminder',\n    text: `Reminder: You have an appointment on ${appointmentDate}.`\n  };\n\n  await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);\n};\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n### ⏰ Setting Up a Reminder Scheduler\n\nTo automate reminders, we can use **cron jobs** with **node-cron**.\n\n```\nnpm install node-cron\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nIn `scripts/reminderScheduler.js`, set up a cron job:\n\n```\nimport cron from 'node-cron';\nimport db from '../db';\nimport { sendReminderEmail } from '../utils/sendReminderEmail';\n\ncron.schedule('0 9 * * *', () =\u003e { // Run every day at 9 AM\n  const today = new Date();\n  db.query('SELECT * FROM appointments WHERE appointment_date = ?', [today], (err, results) =\u003e {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    results.forEach(async (appointment) =\u003e {\n      const { customer_email, appointment_date } = appointment;\n      await sendReminderEmail(customer_email, appointment_date);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nAdd the scheduler to your application startup script to run in the background.\n\n### 🎉 Wrapping Up\n\nOur **automated scheduling system** is now complete! With Next.js, MySQL, a calendar, and automated email reminders, this setup will make scheduling seamless.\n\n## Top comments (0)\n\nSubscribe\n\n![pic](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=256,height=,fit=scale-down,gravity=auto,format=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8j7kvp660rqzt99zui8e.png)\n\nPersonalTrusted User\n\n[Create template](/settings/response-templates)\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nSubmitPreview [Dismiss](/404.html)\n\n[Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct)• [Report abuse](/report-abuse)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Data at Scale: Unlocking the Secrets of Hive and Cassandra in Distributed Systems\n\n[#systemdesign](/t/systemdesign) [#programming](/t/programming) [#learning](/t/learning) [#database](/t/database)\n\nImagine a world where every piece of digital information—every tweet, transaction, and temperature reading—could be processed and analyzed almost instantly, no matter the scale. This isn't just a dream scenario for data scientists and IT professionals; it's becoming a daily reality thanks to the advancements in large-scale data stores operating in distributed computing environments.\n\nIn the realm of big data, the challenge isn't just collecting information but managing, processing, and extracting value from it across multiple, often globally dispersed, computing resources. Distributed computing addresses these challenges by dispersing data workloads across many servers, enhancing both performance and fault tolerance.\n\nIn this blog, we take a look into the operation of big data stores, predominantly with a focus on Apache Hive and Apache Cassandra. These are classic examples of integrating principles of distributed computing with state-of-the-art data management techniques to offer scalable, reliable, and efficient solutions. We will take a deeper dive into how these data stores work, their architecture, and why they become one of the most important components in extracting the full potential of distributed computing in order to carry out large-scale data operations.\n\n## Basics of Distributed Computing\n\n**What is Distributed Computing?**\n\nThink of distributed computing as a team sport. Just like a football team spreads out across the field, each player (or computer, in this case) has a specific role to play. This setup allows tasks to be handled simultaneously, speeding up processing and making the system more reliable. Instead of one giant supercomputer doing all the work, we have many smaller computers (called nodes) working together. This teamwork approach makes handling vast amounts of data more efficient and faster.\n\n[![Image description](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjetthmvnh3prvcqv5l54.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fjetthmvnh3prvcqv5l54.png)\n\n)\n\n**Key Concepts in Distributed Computing**\n\n- **Nodes**: These are like individual team players. Each node is a separate computer responsible for a portion of the workload.\n\n- **Clusters**: Imagine a group of players forming a strategy. A cluster is a team of nodes working together closely to complete tasks more efficiently than they could individually.\n\n- **Distributed File Systems**: Think of this as the playbook shared among players. It ensures that all nodes can access the necessary data to perform their tasks, no matter where they are located.\n\n- **MapReduce**: This is a game plan for processing large sets of data. It involves breaking down the task into smaller chunks (Map) and then combining the results to solve a larger problem (Reduce).\n\n- **NoSQL Databases**: These are like specialized training techniques for players. They are designed to handle lots of different types of data quickly and without strict rules that traditional databases adhere to, making them perfect for diverse and rapidly changing data.\n\n\n**Real-Life Example of Distributed Computing**\n\nConsider a global delivery company that needs to track thousands of packages shipped across various routes daily. Distributed computing allows the company to use computers in different locations to handle local data about packages. This system ensures that data is processed near its source, speeding up the tracking process and making it more efficient.\n\n**Challenges in Distributed Computing**\n\n- **Scalability**: As the team grows (more nodes), managing everyone becomes more complex. The system must handle this growth without slowing down or becoming inefficient.\n\n- **Fault Tolerance**: Sometimes, a player might get injured (node failure). The system needs to continue without interruption, automatically passing the injured player's tasks to others.\n\n- **Consistency**: All team members need to have up-to-date and consistent information. In distributed computing, ensuring that all nodes show the same data, even if they are updated at different times, can be tricky.\n\n- **Latency**: Communication delays between players (nodes) in different locations can affect gameplay. The system needs strategies to minimize these delays to maintain performance.\n\n\n## Dive into Large-Scale Data Stores\n\n### Apache Hive\n\n[![Image description](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu9vwb3784f6s9oebmnrt.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu9vwb3784f6s9oebmnrt.png)\n\n**Overview and Architecture**\n\nApache Hive is like the brains of a data operation, designed to make sense of large volumes of data. Hive provides a SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop. It's built on top of the Hadoop ecosystem and converts SQL queries into MapReduce jobs, making it an essential tool for data warehousing tasks.\n\n**How Hive Operates on Top of Hadoop**\n\nThink of Hadoop as the foundation of a building, while Hive is the upper structure that makes the space livable and functional. Hive uses Hadoop's Distributed File System (HDFS) to store its data and Hadoop's MapReduce to process the data. Hive's architecture allows users to interact with data in Hadoop using SQL, which is familiar to those who have used traditional relational databases, thereby simplifying the complexities of Hadoop.\n\n**Use Cases and Advantages**\n\n- **Use Cases**: Ideal for data warehousing applications where large datasets are batch-processed and analyzed.\n\n- **Advantages**: Provides a familiar SQL interface, which reduces the learning curve for database professionals and allows complex transformations and analysis on big data.\n\n\n### Apache Cassandra\n\n[![Image description](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1s39gdaaqn2sbgg5yspi.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F1s39gdaaqn2sbgg5yspi.png)\n\n**Overview and Architecture**\n\nApache Cassandra is like a warehouse designed for speed and scale. It's a highly scalable, high-performance distributed database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers without a single point of failure. Its architecture is a peer-to-peer distributed system where all nodes (servers) are the same; there's no master that could become a bottleneck or a single point of failure.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **Decentralized**: Every node in the cluster has the same role, there is no master node, which helps in avoiding bottlenecks.\n\n- **Replication and Multi-data Center Distribution**: Cassandra is designed to replicate data automatically to multiple nodes and data centers, enhancing data availability and disaster recovery.\n\n\n**Use Cases and Advantages**\n\n- **Use Cases**: Perfect for applications needing high availability and scalability, such as IoT, web data, and mobile apps.\n\n- **Advantages**: Provides robust support for clusters spanning multiple data centers, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.\n\n\n### Comparison with Other Data Stores\n\n**HBase vs. Cassandra**\n\n- **HBase**: Optimized for read-heavy applications where access to large datasets is required rapidly. It's best for real-time querying of big data.\n\n- **Cassandra**: Better suited for write-heavy applications due to its efficient write performance and ability to handle very high write volumes.\n\n\n**MongoDB vs. Cassandra**\n\n- **MongoDB**: Offers more flexible data storage with a document-oriented model, suitable for applications that need dynamic queries and need to handle a variety of data types.\n\n- **Cassandra**: Focuses on performance, linear scalability, and durability, making it better for applications requiring massive scalability and high reliability across multiple data centers.\n\n\n**When to Use Each**\n\n**Data Store****Best for****Strengths****Typical Use Cases****Apache Hive**Complex, ad-hoc querying of big dataFamiliar SQL interface, integrates well with Hadoop, good for batch processingData warehousing, business intelligence, large-scale analytics**Apache Cassandra**High write volumes, scalabilityHorizontal scalability, no single point of failure, masterless architectureWeb and mobile apps, IoT, write-heavy applications**HBase**Real-time read/write accessFast access to large datasets, scales horizontally, integrates with HadoopReal-time analytics, monitoring apps, where speed is critical**MongoDB**Dynamic queries and diverse data typesFlexible document model, dynamic schemas, robust indexing and querying capabilitiesCatalogs, content management, applications with varied data\n\n## Core Technologies Behind These Data Stores\n\n### **Data Partitioning (Sharding)**\n\nData partitioning, commonly known as sharding, is like dividing a big task among your team members to complete it faster. In distributed data stores, sharding involves splitting large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces, or 'shards', that can be distributed across multiple servers or nodes. This approach not only speeds up data retrieval by allowing operations to run concurrently across multiple shards but also enhances horizontal scaling, as shards can be spread across additional machines as data grows.\n\n### **Replication Strategies**\n\nReplication is akin to keeping backup copies of your documents. In distributed databases, data is replicated across different nodes or servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. If one node fails, the system can automatically switch to a replica without any data loss or downtime. There are various replication strategies, such as:\n\n- **Master-slave replication:** One node is the 'master' that handles writes, while one or more 'slave' nodes handle reads and serve as backups.\n\n- **Peer-to-peer replication:** Each node can accept reads and writes, acting as both master and replica, which eliminates single points of failure.\n\n\n### **Consistency Models**\n\nImagine if everyone in your team had slightly different versions of the same document. Confusing, right? Consistency models in distributed systems ensure that all nodes show the same data at any given time, which can be challenging due to replication and the inherent latency of data distribution. The two primary models are:\n\n- **Eventual Consistency:** Updates to one node will propagate to all nodes eventually, ensuring that all replicas become consistent over time. This model allows for high availability and performance but at the cost of immediate consistency.\n\n- **Strong Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error. Although this model ensures that all users see the same data at the same time, it can compromise availability in the event of a node failure.\n\n\n### **CAP Theorem Implications**\n\nThe CAP Theorem is a fundamental principle that posits that a distributed system can only simultaneously guarantee two of the following three properties:\n\n- **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.\n\n- **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.\n\n- **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (due to network failures).\n\n\nIn practice, while all systems aim for partition tolerance (since network failures are common), developers must choose between prioritizing consistency or availability, leading to different configurations based on specific application needs.\n\n## Real-World Applications and Case Studies\n\nIn this section, we will explore how large-scale data stores like Apache Hive and Apache Cassandra are used in real-world scenarios, examining the benefits and discussing how these technologies enhance scalability and performance.\n\n### Apache Hive in Action\n\n**Company Example: Facebook**\n\n- **Usage**: Facebook uses Apache Hive for data warehousing, allowing them to analyze petabytes of data efficiently. Hive enables their analysts, who are already familiar with SQL, to run queries on massive datasets stored in Hadoop without needing to learn new programming paradigms.\n\n- **Benefits**: Hive facilitates easy data summarization, querying, and analysis of large volumes of data. It supports Facebook's data analysts in generating reports that influence product decisions and user experience strategies.\n\n\n### Apache Cassandra in Action\n\n**Company Example: Netflix**\n\n- **Usage**: Netflix employs Apache Cassandra to handle its massive scale and real-time requirements, particularly for services like tracking watched history and bookmarks across millions of users worldwide.\n\n- **Benefits**: Cassandra's ability to handle thousands of write operations per second while maintaining operational simplicity and robustness is crucial for Netflix’s 24/7 uptime and quick data access demands.\n\n\n### Scalability and Performance Improvements\n\n**Scalability**\n\n- **Hive**: As data grows, Hive scales horizontally by adding more machines to the Hadoop cluster. This scalability is crucial for companies like Facebook, where data volume and demand for faster processing grow continually.\n\n- **Cassandra**: Cassandra’s architecture is designed to scale linearly; doubling the number of nodes doubles the capacity without a significant increase in latency. This feature is particularly beneficial for services like Netflix, which experience massive and often unpredictable spikes in workload.\n\n\n**Performance Improvements**\n\n- **Hive**: By converting SQL queries into `MapReduce` jobs, Hive optimizes the execution across multiple nodes, thereby utilizing the full power of the underlying Hadoop infrastructure. This results in efficient processing of large-scale data queries.\n\n- **Cassandra**: Cassandra's distributed nature allows it to process large volumes of writes very quickly. Its data distribution and replication strategies ensure minimal impact on performance even as the system scales.\n\n\n### Challenges and Best Practices in Managing Large-Scale Data Stores\n\n#### Challenges\n\n- **Complex Setup and Maintenance**: Deploying and maintaining distributed data stores like Apache Hive and Cassandra involves intricate configuration and continuous optimization to handle varying data loads and ensure peak performance.\n\n- **Data Consistency Issues**: Achieving consistency across distributed nodes can be complex, particularly with systems that prioritize high availability and fault tolerance, such as Cassandra’s eventual consistency model.\n\n- **Data Skew and Load Balancing**: Data skew occurs when certain nodes handle more data or traffic than others, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. Balancing the load effectively across nodes is crucial for maintaining system efficiency.\n\n- **Scalability Costs**: While these databases scale horizontally, the infrastructure costs—both hardware and operational—can escalate quickly as data and throughput demands increase.\n\n\n#### Best Practices\n\n- **Effective Data Modeling**: For Cassandra, it's crucial to model data based on the anticipated query patterns, which involves understanding partition keys and data distribution. In Hive, organizing data into efficient partitions and using bucketing can drastically improve query performance.\n\n- **Proactive Monitoring**: Employing robust monitoring tools to track performance metrics and system health can preemptively address issues before they impact operations. This includes monitoring disk usage, read/write latencies, and node health.\n\n- **Regular Software Updates**: Keeping the data store software up-to-date is vital to leverage new features, performance improvements, and security patches that enhance overall system robustness.\n\n- **Load Testing**: Conduct systematic load testing to simulate real-world usage patterns. This helps identify potential scalability issues and the system’s behavior under stress.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLarge-scale data stores like Apache Hive and Apache Cassandra play an indispensable role in the ecosystem of distributed computing. They enable organizations to manage vast quantities of data efficiently, providing the scalability and flexibility required in today’s data-driven environment. As data volumes continue to grow exponentially, the ability to effectively deploy, manage, and leverage these technologies becomes a pivotal factor in an organization’s success.\n\nBy overcoming the inherent challenges and adhering to established best practices, companies can maximize the potential of their data infrastructure to drive innovation, enhance customer experiences, and make informed decisions that keep them competitive in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\n\nWe at [**CreoWis**](https://creowis.com/) believe in sharing knowledge publicly to help the developer community grow.
